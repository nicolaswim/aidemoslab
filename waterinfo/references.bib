	abstract = {Much of the world’s data are stored, managed, and distributed by data centers. Data centers require a tremendous amount of energy to operate, accounting for around 1.8\% of electricity use in the United States. Large amounts of water are also required to operate data centers, both directly for liquid cooling and indirectly to produce electricity. For the first time, we calculate spatially-detailed carbon and water footprints of data centers operating within the United States, which is home to around one-quarter of all data center servers globally. Our bottom-up approach reveals one-fifth of data center servers direct water footprint comes from moderately to highly water stressed watersheds, while nearly half of servers are fully or partially powered by power plants located within water stressed regions. Approximately 0.5\% of total US greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to data centers. We investigate tradeoffs and synergies between data center’s water and energy utilization by strategically locating data centers in areas of the country that will minimize one or more environmental footprints. Our study quantifies the environmental implications behind our data creation and storage and shows a path to decrease the environmental footprint of our increasing digital footprint.},

	abstract = {The growing carbon footprint of artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large ones such as GPT-3, has been undergoing public scrutiny. Unfortunately, however, the equally important and enormous water (withdrawal and consumption) footprint of AI models has remained under the radar. For example, training GPT-3 in Microsoft’s state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, but such information has been kept a secret. More critically, the global AI demand may be accountable for 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4 – 6 Denmark or half of the United Kingdom. This is very concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges shared by all of us in the wake of the rapidly growing population, depleting water resources, and aging water infrastructures. To respond to the global water challenges, AI models can, and also must, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing their own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate the water footprint of AI models, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of AI models’ runtime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable AI.},

	abstract = {As AI is becoming more a part of our lives, people are starting to worry about the negative consequences it might have on the environment. One of the major issues is its high water consumption. The water[21] consumption of AI models, including Chat GPT, is a major concern and must be managed effectively to reduce environmental harm. This document examines the amount[15] of water that is utilized by Chat GPT and other AI models and investigates the impact that it may have on the environment, as well as possible solutions to control their water usage. The study further considers the plausibility and usefulness of these approaches. The findings imply that although water usage of AI systems is significantly lower compared to other industries, it is still a matter of concern. AI models can have a significant water footprint, but this can be reduced by taking certain measures such as improving energy efficiency, utilizing renewable energy sources, optimizing algorithms and implementing strategies to conserve water. Despite the potential of these solutions, there are still issues to be addressed, such as the expense associated with implementation, and further research is required for optimum utilization. In conclusion, this document emphasizes the relevance of recognizing the water footprint caused by AI models, giving important details regarding potential solutions to minimize their environmental impact.},

	abstract = {While there is a growing effort towards AI for Sustainability (e.g. towards the sustainable development goals) it is time to move beyond that and to address the sustainability of developing and using AI systems. In this paper I propose a definition of Sustainable AI; Sustainable AI is a movement to foster change in the entire lifecycle of AI products (i.e. idea generation, training, re-tuning, implementation, governance) towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. As such, Sustainable AI is focused on more than AI applications; rather, it addresses the whole sociotechnical system of AI. I have suggested here that Sustainable AI is not about how to sustain the development of AI per say but it is about how to develop AI that is compatible with sustaining environmental resources for current and future generations; economic models for societies; and societal values that are fundamental to a given society. I have articulated that the phrase Sustainable AI be understood as having two branches; AI for sustainability and sustainability of AI (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions and computing power). I propose that Sustainable AI take sustainable development at the core of its definition with three accompanying tensions between AI innovation and equitable resource distribution; inter and intra-generational justice; and, between environment, society, and economy. This paper is not meant to engage with each of the three pillars of sustainability (i.e. social, economic, environment), and as such the pillars of sustainable AI. Rather, this paper is meant to inspire the reader, the policy maker, the AI ethicist, the AI developer to connect with the environment—to remember that there are environmental costs to AI. Further, to direct funding towards sustainable methods of AI.},

The focus lies on the transparency and the ecological sustainability of AI as two key challenges tied to possible long-term impacts on societies. Findings from survey data representative of the German population show overall moderate to strong support for the government regulating AI. Perceived regulatory competence of policymakers is positively associated with citizens' support for soft regulation. Lower trust in tech companies is linked to a lower readiness to rely on soft regulation, but not to more demand for hard regulation. While regulatory preferences barely map on political conflict lines, people's future orientation emerges as a strong correlate of support for both hard and soft regulation. Citizens thus seem to perceive a clear sustainability dimension in the development and governance of AI. © 2023},

This paper briefly delves into AI/ML and recaps some key essentials, covering AI and ML subfields, ML methods, industries where AI/ML finds relevance, key stages and the common technical challenges in ML development. Importantly, the paper shifts attention from the latter to underscore the duo of transparency and ethics in AI, highlighting specifically what these are and why they are important, subsequently positing a PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal) framework for AI design, build and implementation.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for the infrastructures that support many of society’s functions. Transportation, security, energy, education, the workplace, the government have all incorporated AI into their infrastructures for enhancement and/or protection. In this paper, we argue that not only is AI seen as a tool for augmenting existing infrastructures, but AI itself is becoming an infrastructure that many services of today and tomorrow will depend upon. Considering the vast environmental consequences associated with the development and use of AI, of which the world is only starting to learn, the necessity of addressing AI alongside the concept of infrastructure points toward the phenomenon of carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in refers to society’s constrained ability to reduce carbon emissions technologically, economically, politically, and socially. These constraints are due to the inherent inertia created by entrenched technological, institutional, and behavioral norms. That is, the drive for AI adoption in virtually every sector of society will create dependencies and interdependencies from which it will be hard to escape. The crux of this paper boils down to this: in conceptualizing AI as infrastructure we can recognize the risk of lock-in, not just carbon lock-in but lock-in as it relates to all the physical needs to achieve the infrastructure of AI. This does not exclude the possibility of solutions arising with the rise of these technologies; however, given these points, it is of the utmost importance that we ask inconvenient questions regarding these environmental costs before becoming locked into this new AI infrastructure. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology that has great potential in reducing energy consumption, environmental burdens, and operational risks of chemical production. However, large-scale applications of AI are still limited. One barrier is the lack of quantitative understandings of the potential benefits and risks of different AI applications. This study reviewed relevant AI literature and categorized those case studies by application types, impact categories, and application modes. Most studies assessed the energy, economic, and safety implications of AI applications, while few of them have evaluated the environmental impacts of AI, given the large data gaps and difficulties in choosing appropriate assessment methods. Based on the reviewed case studies in the chemical industry, we proposed a conceptual framework that encompasses approaches from industrial ecology, economics, and engineering to guide the selection of performance indicators and evaluation methods for a holistic assessment of AI's impacts. This framework could be a valuable tool to support the decision-making related to AI in the fundamental research and practical production of chemicals. Although this study focuses on the chemical industry, the insights of the literature review and the proposed framework could be applied to AI applications in other industries and broad industrial ecology fields. In the end, this study highlights future research directions for addressing the data challenges in assessing AI's impacts and developing AI-enhanced tools to support the sustainable development of the chemical industry. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {This project investigates the conceptual foundations of ‘sustainability’ with the goal of assessing approaches to the ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) under the lens of that notion. In a previous paper, my co-authors, Tijs Vandemeulebroucke and Aimee van Wynsberghe, and I have suspected that in order to do justice to the normative demands of sustainability, the way in which we conceive of AI ethics, AI regulation, and ultimately AI as a technology has to be adjusted [1]. The study of ‘Sustainable AI', i.e. of AI applications for sustainability and of the sustainability of AI itself [2], is currently in its infancy. First publications in the field point to significant environmental and social costs attached to the widespread adoption of AI technologies [3][4][5]. And yet, comprehensive frameworks for how these costs can be identified, assessed, and evaluated are largely missing. At the same time, a particular approach to AI policy crystallises – there is a tendency in AI Ethics Guideline documents to focus on technical fixes for isolated artefacts, deterministically construed, that lie in the responsibility of expert technicians – an approach my colleagues and I have dubbed an “ethics of carefulness” [1]. For the most part, they do not consider broader societal transformations, the embeddedness of AI technologies in social and ecological structures, or the possibility of not developing a particular AI application at all. By contrast, in the context of discourse on AI and sustainability, AI has increasingly been conceptualised not as an artefact, but rather as infrastructure. This includes consideration of the hardware infrastructure that is necessary to run AI algorithms [6][7], the fact that AI underpins and upholds infrastructures [8][9], and that the interplay of AI algorithms and their environment also constitutes an infrastructure in its own right [1][9]. Indeed, it has been argued that conceptualising and assessing the sustainability of AI requires considering AI artefacts not in isolation, but rather in their embeddedness in the broader ecological and socio-technical systems that surround, enable, and constitute them [1][10]. It seems that sustainability is simply not ‘happening’ at the artefact level. This may explain why social and ecological costs of AI, costs related to sustainability, are often described as “hidden”[2][8]: Through the lens of an ethics of carefulness, they are invisible. My research contributes a thorough examination of the normative demands inherent to the sustainability perspective. These demands require modelling AI not as a particular artefact, but rather as a socio-technical system embedded in social, environmental, and economic structures. The normative demands of sustainability would thus require a different ontology for AI than the one that is predominantly found in AI policy documents. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

	abstract = {As ChatGPT et al. conquer the world, the optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive and a revision of the Product Liability Directive. They constitute the final cornerstone of EU AI regulation. Crucially, the liability proposals and the EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a Brussels Effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and beyond. This paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the Commission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments, which are collected in an Annex at the end of the paper. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. This includes: a comprehensive framework for AI liability; provisions to support innovation; an extension to non-discrimination/algorithmic fairness, as well as explainable AI; and sustainability. I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but potentially also sustainable AI (SAI).},

With great power comes great responsibility. The emphasis on profit maximization led carbon majors to be one of the main contributors to climate change. Additionally, globalized and multi-level production and trade have led to concerns for human rights in business processes.

The planetary crisis, modern slavery, and democratic erosion propelled Academy fellows and faculty to respond with urgency. As the TBLSA Impact Paper puts forth, business law and finance offer effective avenues, such as the purpose-driven business model and the revaluation of asset management, for a just transition which takes into account climate justice, more meaningful transparency, and algorithm accountability so long as public and private actors implement the concrete policy recommendations proposed in this brief.},

Instead of merely focusing on ethics or human rights, scholars and policy makers should acknowledge sustainable AI development (SAID) as guiding framework. The chapter explains the current state of the discourse on sustainable development and gives specific examples of several AI technologies. The chapter shows that SAID is an inclusive framework that accommodates individual, group and societal interests and is not only framed as a pathology but also as a policy process in order to achieve certain goals. A governance structure was implemented and has been improved in order to achieve these goals. The basic argument of this chapter is that AI should not only used to achieve the sustainable development goals but be designed in order to meet the criteria set out by SAID. What this could mean is shown with regards to access to justice and two case studies, which offer insights into the potential of SAID as a governance framework for AI. The first case-study relates to the chatbot DoNotPay, the second case study to Australia’s Centrelink system of automatically asking for repayment of alledged debts.},

These systems often address Health Inequalities during healthcare promotion. Unfortunately, the complexity of these inequalities continuously affects vulnerable populations and developing economies. This is mainly attributed to the variations in social determinants caused by social inequalities among social groups in the general population with their intersecting social factors. Numerous technologies like Mobile Health have been developed to address issues of Equitable access to healthcare. Unfortunately, some of the disruptive underlying innovative technologies facilitating Mobile health for example Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) still exhibit algorithmic unfairness. This is mainly attributed to inequitable healthcare datasets arising from the contextual and intersectional differences among the beneficiaries of the Mobile Health services. Moreover, AI and ML are now globally adopted in establishing sustainable intelligent predictive and preventive Mobile Healthcare systems, despite the lag in shifting and adopting contextually appealing research paradigms for responsibly creating inclusive AI and ML training datasets for Intelligent Healthcare Technologies. This chapter critically reviews conventional research paradigms, their essential elements, and their contextual application in creating AI and ML training datasets for sustainable healthcare and Health Equity.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the field of medical imaging and has the potential to bring medicine from the era of ‘sick-care’ to the era of healthcare and prevention. The development of AI requires access to large, complete, and harmonized real-world datasets, representative of the population, and disease diversity. However, to date, efforts are fragmented, based on single–institution, size-limited, and annotation-limited datasets. Available public datasets (e.g., The Cancer Imaging Archive, TCIA, USA) are limited in scope, making model generalizability really difficult. In this direction, five European Union projects are currently working on the development of big data infrastructures that will enable European, ethically and General Data Protection Regulation-compliant, quality-controlled, cancer-related, medical imaging platforms, in which both large-scale data and AI algorithms will coexist. The vision is to create sustainable AI cloud-based platforms for the development, implementation, verification, and validation of trustable, usable, and reliable AI models for addressing specific unmet needs regarding cancer care provision. In this paper, we present an overview of the development efforts highlighting challenges and approaches selected providing valuable feedback to future attempts in the area. Key points • Artificial intelligence models for health imaging require access to large amounts of harmonized imaging data and metadata. • Main infrastructures adopted either collect centrally anonymized data or enable access to pseudonymized distributed data. • Developing a common data model for storing all relevant information is a challenge. • Trust of data providers in data sharing initiatives is essential. • An online European Union meta-tool-repository is a necessity minimizing effort duplication for the various projects in the area. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: This work aims to establish the relationship between painting art and sustainability, which allows for highlighting implications likely to improve sustainability for humanity's welfare. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this objective, painting art is measured by a composite index aggregating the quantity and quality represented by the market value. As for sustainable development, it is represented by a composite index comprising three variables: the climate change performance index (ecological dimension), the wage index reflecting distributive justice (social dimension) and the gross domestic product (economic dimension). The composite indices were determined through adjusted data envelopment analysis. In addition, two other methods are used in this work: correlation analysis and a neural network method. These methods are applied to data from 2007 to 2021 across the world. Findings: The correlation method highlighted a perfect positive correlation between painting art and sustainability. As for the neural network method, it revealed that the quality of painting has the greatest impact on sustainability. The neural network method also showed that the most positively impacted variable of sustainability by painting art is the social variable, with a pseudo-probability of 0.90. Originality/value: The relationship between painting art and sustainability is underexplored, in particular in terms of statistical analysis. Therefore, this research intends to fill this gap. Moreover, analysis of the relationship between both using composite indices computed via an original method (adjusted data envelopment analysis) and a neural network method is nonexistent, which constitutes the novelty of this work.

	abstract = {This innovative handbook provides a comprehensive, and truly global, overview of the main approaches and themes within law and society scholarship or social-legal studies. A one-volume introduction to academic resources and ideas that are relevant for today's debates on issues from reproductive justice to climate justice, food security, water conflicts, artificial intelligence, and global financial transactions, this handbook is divided into two sections. The first, 'Perspectives and Approaches', accessibly explains a variety of frameworks through which the relationship between law and society is addressed and understood, with emphasis on contemporary perspectives that are relatively new to many socio-legal scholars. Following the book's overall interest in social justice, the entries in this section of the book show how conceptual tools originate in, and help to illuminate, real-world issues. The second and largest section of the book (42 short well-written pieces) presents reflections on topics or areas concerning law, justice, and society that are inherently interdisciplinary and that are relevance to current - but also classical - struggles around justice. Informing readers about the lineage of ideas that are used or could be used today for research and activism, the book attends to the full range of local, national and transnational issues in law and society. The authors were carefully chosen to achieve a diverse and non-Eurocentric view of socio-legal studies. This volume will be invaluable for law students, those in inter-disciplinary programs such as law and society, justice studies and legal studies, and those with interests in law, but based in other social sciences. It will also appeal to general readers interested in questions of justice and rights, including activists and advocates around the world. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Mariana Valverde, Kamari Clarke, Eve Darian-Smith, and Prabha Kotiswaran; individual chapters, the contributors.},

However, brownfield redevelopment strategies were often operated independently from regional development in Taiwan. Regional development is a dynamic process; however, there is a research gap in understanding how regional development can serve as an incentive for brownfield redevelopment. This study established a model for assessing regional sustainability using machine learning (ML-RSD), that model used principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) to predict the comprehensive evaluation rating of regional development at the township level and to explore the trends of regional governance sustainability. The results of ML-RSD that are compared to commonly used methods (driver-pressure-state-impact-response and entropy weight method) were consistent. Indicators such as the protection of vulnerable groups (SDG1), food security (SDG2), good health and well-being (SDG3), inclusive and equitable quality education (SDG4), environmental protection (SDG6), accessible and reliable energy (SDG7), and sustainable economic growth (SDG8) were identified as the main factors affecting regional development. Additionally, the model achieved an accuracy value exceeding 80\%. Additionally, the results showed that there was no significant correlation between the delisted site (completed remediation) and regional development in southern Taiwan. The model underscored the overall lower comprehensive sustainable values for regions affected by inadequate land rehabilitation governance (SDG15). The results present that brownfield redevelopment strategies should enhance their effectiveness in land adaptation and integrating brownfield redevelopment with regional sustainable development is essential for it to become a win-win solution.},

This review also investigates the potentials of conventional EC techniques in influencing water demand management policies beyond an advisory role while recommending strategies for their use by policy-makers with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in perspective. This review ultimately proposes a novel integrated water demand and management modelling framework (IWDMMF) that enables water policy-makers to assess the wider impact of water demand management decisions through the principles of egalitarianism, utilitarianism, libertarianism and sufficientarianism. This is necessary to ensure that water policy decisions incorporate equity and justice.

Many contestations arise from the effects of inequitable access and intersecting crises currently faced by cities, which may be amplified by the algorithmic and data-centric infrastructures being introduced in urban contexts. In this article, I argue for a critical lens into how inter-related urban technologies, big data and policies, constituted as Urban AI, offer both challenges and opportunities. I examine scenarios of contestations in urban mobility, defined broadly to include equitable access, movement, and liberty to engage with the socio-cultural, political, and urban fabric of cities. I anchor my arguments through a framework of rights, risks, and responsibilities for critically examining and configuring the roles, values and ethical implications for all stakeholders including human, AI and non-human entities within an urban ecosystem. As a way forward, I examine the European Commission’s proposed regulations on AI systems through an illustrative case study of an automated parking control system introduced by the City of Amsterdam. In moving beyond the city to broader urban ecosystems, I highlight the role of engaging Indigenous perspectives for designing and reconciling the implications of equitable and sustainable Urban AI ecosystems in the future. © 2022, The Author(s).},

In this paper, we demarcate the key issues surrounding these fields using five unique Rs, namely, rationalizability, resilience, reproducibility, realism, and responsibility. Notably, just as air serves as the basic element of biological life, the term AIR5 - cumulatively referring to the five aforementioned Rs - is introduced herein to mark some of the basic elements of artificial life, for sustainable AI and CI.

While it is mostly used to denote threats to humanity as a whole, like climate change or AI, it is also used on a smaller scale. Existential threat to a state or a similar entity is often evoked too. Such a threat is considered grave enough to justify war and – possibly – the use of nuclear weapons. In the present article, the author aims to deconstruct the notion of “existential threat” in relation to the state and show that it should not be used as a reason to go to war. The main argument is that the state has a specific mode of existence which makes it impossible to speak of state death unambiguously. Therefore, there can be no apparent threats to its existence. The author proposes a normative interpretation of the state. The state is understood as a project of a certain group, or even an individual, therefore the discussion of “existential threat” to a state should be dropped in favor of a more grounded evaluation of potential gains and losses by different social groups and political parties. © 2023, Sergey Kucherenko.},

	abstract = {So far, little effort has been devoted to developing practical approaches on how to develop and deploy AI systems that meet certain standards and principles. This is despite the importance of principles such as privacy, fairness, and social equality taking centre stage in discussions around AI. However, for an organization, failing to meet those standards can give rise to significant lost opportunities. It may further lead to an organization's demise, as the example of Cambridge Analytica demonstrates. It is, however, possible to pursue a practical approach for the design, development, and deployment of sustainable AI systems that incorporates both business and human values and principles. This book discusses the concept of sustainability in the context of artificial intelligence. In order to help businesses achieve this objective, the author introduces the sustainable artificial intelligence framework (SAIF), designed as a reference guide in the development and deployment of AI systems. The SAIF developed in the book is designed to help decision makers such as policy makers, boards, C-suites, managers, and data scientists create AI systems that meet ethical principles. By focusing on four pillars related to the socio-economic and political impact of AI, the SAIF creates an environment through which an organization learns to understand its risk and exposure to any undesired consequences of AI, and the impact of AI on its ability to create value in the short, medium, and long term. What You Will Learn • See the relevance of ethics to the practice of data science and AI • Examine the elements that enable AI within an organization • Discover the challenges of developing AI systems that meet certain human or specific standards • Explore the challenges of AI governance • Absorb the key factors to consider when evaluating AI systems Who This Book Is For Decision makers such as government officials, members of the C-suite and other business managers, and data scientists as well as any technology expert aspiring to a data-related leadership role. © 2021 by Ghislain Landry Tsafack Chetsa.

	abstract = {The pandemic has exacerbated the effects of the digital transformation: the extractive economy is steadily giving way to the new economic space—the digital economy. This transformation shakes the very foundations of the existence and purpose of law, i.e., the regulation of social relations. However, today, the consequences of developing tech in an unsustainable manner are becoming obvious. Despite the internet’s many benefits, it also erodes trust and fuels misinformation, polarization, and inequality. These developments occur partly because the algorithms that shape our economies, society, and even public discourse were developed with few legal restrictions or commonly held ethical standards. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the technologies that currently shape our socio-economic relations must be consistent with both our shared norms and values and the existing rules. The main question of this study is how to correctly introduce tech that is legal by design, but also, and especially, liable and sustainable by design. The underlying questions are hence, firstly: to this end, do we need (to create) a whole new body of norms, law, and regulation? Alternatively, are there already legal fields, concepts, and tools that can help us lay comprehensive groundwork for tech that is liable and sustainable by design? The central object of this study is to address this problem with regard to the types of organization that is in any way involved in or at least related to tech and innovation, essentially, the Web 3-4 actors. My principal method is systems analysis, which engages with a system as a whole. The construct of regulatory compliant and sustainable tech is thus analysed both functionally and institutionally, with concepts including norm-setting and law-making, formal application and enforcement, case law, real-world effects, and limitations. The objective of the article is to first synthesize the pre-existing legal and regulatory fields and constructs, and then analyse in a succinct yet systematic manner the conditions for their applicability to, and efficiency for, regulation of Web 3.0 (and soon, Web 4.0), as well as their limits. In the course of the study, I found that there are a few pre-existing legal fields, concepts, and tools that can pave the way to creating a Web that is liable and sustainable by design. I have also identified two key developments that arise from the digital transformation: (i) the digital economic space creates the so-called governance and regulatory gaps; and (ii) some of these gaps are rapidly filled (at times, successfully and at times, less so) by a burgeoning newest legal framework (national and supranational targeted regulation, legislation, and case law), which has been growing especially rapidly since the global digital ‘leap’ facilitated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the beginning of the 2020s. To conclude, the article summarizes both pre-existing and new tools and thus offers a ready-to-use toolkit for a regulatory compliant and sustainable tech (including a table summarizing the toolkit), which is the key aim of this paper. © 2023 by the author.},

However, sustainability is not tantamount to the reduction of environmental costs. By shifting the focus to intergenerational justice as one of the constitutive normative pillars of sustainability, the paper identifies a reductionist view on the sustainability of AI and constructively contributes a conceptual extension. It further develops a framework that establishes normative issues of intergenerational justice raised by the uses of AI. The framework reveals how using AI for decision support to policies with long-term impacts can negatively affect future persons. In particular, the analysis demonstrates that uses of AI for decision support to policies of environmental protection or climate mitigation include assumptions about social discounting and future persons’ preferences. These assumptions are highly controversial and have a significant influence on the weight assigned to the potentially detrimental impacts of a policy on future persons. Furthermore, these underlying assumptions are seldom transparent within AI. Subsequently, the analysis provides a list of assessment questions that constitutes a guideline for the revision of AI techniques in this regard. In so doing, insights about how AI can be made more sustainable become apparent. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the concept of risk-aware actual value as a pivotal metric for evaluating the viability and desirability of AI projects and services in accordance with the AI Act. The framework establishes a direct correlation between the level of risk associated with a product or service and the resulting actual value generated. The AI Act reflects a concerted effort to harness the potential of AI while mitigating risks. The risk-based approach aligns regulatory measures with the specific attributes and potential hazards of distinct AI applications. As trilogue negotiations continue, the regulatory approach of the EU is evolving, highlighting its commitment to responsible and forward-thinking AI governance. Through a dedicated analysis of the AI Act, it becomes evident that products or services categorized as high-risk carry substantial compliance obligations, consequently diminishing their potential value. This underscores the imperative of exercising caution when engaging in projects with elevated risk profiles. Conversely, products or services characterized by lower risk levels are poised to accrue more substantial benefits from their AI and data potential, highlighting the incentive for a discerning approach to risk assessment. Methodologically, we propose an extension of an integrated AI risk management framework that is already existing in the literature, combining it with existing frameworks for measuring value creation from harnessing AI potential. Additionally, we contribute to the applied field of AI by implementing the proposed risk framework across nine industry-relevant use cases. In summation, this paper furnishes a comprehensive approach to achieving equilibrium between innovation and regulation in the realm of AI projects and services. By employing the risk-aware actual value metric, stakeholders are empowered to make informed decisions that prioritize safety and maximize the potential benefits of AI initiatives. This framework may stand as a reference point in this time when fostering responsible and sustainable AI development within the industry becomes of paramount importance. © 2023 by the author.},

	abstract = {Fairness and environmental impact are important research directions for the sustainable development of artificial intelligence. However, while each topic is an active research area in natural language processing (NLP), there is a surprising lack of research on the interplay between the two fields. This lacuna is highly problematic, since there is increasing evidence that an exclusive focus on fairness can actually hinder environmental sustainability, and vice versa. In this work, we shed light on this crucial intersection in NLP by (1) investigating the efficiency of current fairness approaches through surveying example methods for reducing unfair stereotypical bias from the literature, and (2) evaluating a common technique to reduce energy consumption (and thus environmental impact) of English NLP models, knowledge distillation (KD), for its impact on fairness. In this case study, we evaluate the effect of important KD factors, including layer and dimensionality reduction, with respect to: (a) performance on the distillation task (natural language inference and semantic similarity prediction), and (b) multiple measures and dimensions of stereotypical bias (e.g., gender bias measured via the Word Embedding Association Test). Our results lead us to clarify current assumptions regarding the effect of KD on unfair bias: contrary to other findings, we show that KD can actually decrease model fairness. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

We identify two crucial opportunities that AI offers in this domain: it can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change, and it can contribute to combatting the climate crisis effectively. However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems. We assess the carbon footprint of AI research, and the factors that influence AI’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this domain. We find that the carbon footprint of AI research may be significant and highlight the need for more evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI can offer. In light of our analysis, we argue that leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global climate change whilst limiting its risks is a gambit which requires responsive, evidence-based, and effective governance to become a winning strategy. We conclude by identifying the European Union as being especially well-placed to play a leading role in this policy response and provide 13 recommendations that are designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI for combatting climate change, while reducing its impact on the environment. © 2021, The Author(s).},

However, current “sustainable AI” approaches remain anthropocentric. In this article, we argue from the perspective of applied ethics that such anthropocentric outlook falls short. We present a sentientist approach, arguing that the normative foundation of sustainability and sustainable development—that is, theories of intra- and intergenerational justice—should include sentient animals. Consequently, theories of sustainable AI must also be non-anthropocentric. Moreover, we investigate consequences of our approach for applying AI technologies in a sustainable way. © 2023 The Authors.

Sustainable development has three pillars of sustainability (i.e. social, economic, environment), and as such, the pillars of sustainable AI. The entire Life cycle of AI products can foster change in the movement of sustainability from which greater integrity and social justice can be achieved. Sustainable AI helps us to address the whole socio-technical system more than AI applications. This paper tried to address the positive impacts of AI on sustainable indicators in terms of Environmental, Societal and Economy factors. This paper is prepared to make readers, policymakers, AI ethicists and AI developers to inspire and connect with the environment for the current and future generations as there are few AI costs to be made compatible with the environment. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {This paper introduces the background, concept and definition of the Industry Commons. It initiates a discussion on the positioning of the Industry Commons Ecosystem (ICE) with respect to current research directions in advanced manufacturing and production systems that shape advances in engineering and technology, novel business models and innovation breakthroughs. The potential value of data sharing across industrial domains is estimated at over \$100 billion, particularly in view of optimising manufacturing processes. Data sharing across domains however faces a series of well-documented challenges associated with the lack of semantic interoperability and related standards, management of trust and sustainability. Solving bottlenecks in data sharing requires a systemic approach to data management, which can account for all aspects of data use, levels of application, attribution and dynamic exchanges. In this paper we propose a high-level ecosystem approach that integrates societal values with digital affordances of industry’s cognitive-assisted processes, remote interfacing, hybrid applications and large-scale value networks. Early development of an Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES) is presented as the key enabling framework for Industry Commons interoperability and a series of enabling frameworks form the basis of future research directions in Trusted Data Sharing and Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management for greater sustainability.

Four best practices can reduce ML training energy by up to 100x and CO2 emissions up to 1000x. By following best practices, overall ML energy use (across research, development, and production) held steady at {\textless}15\% of Google's total energy use for the past three years. If the whole ML field were to adopt best practices, total carbon emissions from training would reduce. Hence, we recommend that ML papers include emissions explicitly to foster competition on more than just model quality. Estimates of emissions in papers that omitted them have been off 100x-100,000x, so publishing emissions has the added benefit of ensuring accurate accounting. Given the importance of climate change, we must get the numbers right to make certain that we work on its biggest challenges.},

Their reasoning and decisions need to be based on ethics and scientific facts. They must acknowledge different stakeholders’ social and cultural norms, practices and current and future needs. Unfortunately, designers’ thinking is prone to err, biases, and other psychological phenomena, which can negatively affect how they understand, reason, and make decision, and which can lead to unsustainable and unethical AI solutions. Thus, it is important to investigate errors in designers’ thinking. This study presents a cognitive scientific overview about some common errors when making arguments, inferring, and reasoning, when drawing analogies, or in situations where problems are complex, uncertain, challenging the status quo, or framed differently. Also, processing information, emotions and social and cultural aspects can be source of errors in thinking. Designers must become aware of the risk of errors in their own perceptions, thinking, and reasoning and to explain why, what, and how they design sustainable AI. This can lead to more ethical and sustainable solutions in AI design. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Recently the sleepy Hopfield model (or "dreaming neural network") has been introduced in the Literature as a generalized Hebbian machine able to perform on-line learning when awake, but also to account for (suitably stylized) off-line sleeping mechanisms: this machine has been shown to reach the maximal storage capacity among networks equipped with symmetric pairwise interactions, approaching the perfect memory limit of one bit per synapse in the long sleep time limit.In this paper we test the learning thresholds of this network, that is the minimal amount of information to be provided in the training set to guarantee a successful learning, both on random synthetic as well as on standard structured datasets (e.g., the MNist, Fashion-MNist and Olivetti test cases): by comparing these minimal thresholds of information w.r.t. those required by the standard (i.e., always awake) Hopfield model, we prove that the present network can save up to 90\% of the training set yet preserving the same performance of the just-awake counterpart. This suggests that sleep may play a pivotal role in diminishing the gap between the large volumes of data required to train artificial neural networks and the relatively small volumes needed by their biological counterparts.As a technical aspect, we prove that the model Cost function (typically used in Statistical Mechanics) admits a representation in terms of a standard Loss function (typically used in Machine Learning) and this allows to analyze its emergent computational skills both theoretically and computationally: a quantitative picture of its capabilities as functions of its control parameters is achieved and coherence among the two approaches highlighted. The resulting network is an associative memory for pattern recognition tasks that learns from examples on-line, generalizes correctly (in suitable regions of its control parameters) and optimizes its storage capacity by off-line sleeping: learning machines that minimize the training cost are both welcome toward Sustainable AI and often mandatory in situations where no Big Data are available.},

This survey aims to systematically address these challenges by reviewing a broad spectrum of techniques designed to enhance the resource efficiency of LLMs. We categorize methods based on their optimization focus: computational, memory, energy, financial, and network resources and their applicability across various stages of an LLM's lifecycle, including architecture design, pretraining, finetuning, and system design. Additionally, the survey introduces a nuanced categorization of resource efficiency techniques by their specific resource types, which uncovers the intricate relationships and mappings between various resources and corresponding optimization techniques. A standardized set of evaluation metrics and datasets is also presented to facilitate consistent and fair comparisons across different models and techniques. By offering a comprehensive overview of the current sota and identifying open research avenues, this survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners, aiding them in developing more sustainable and efficient LLMs in a rapidly evolving landscape.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning technique that enables distributed model training across data silos or edge devices without data sharing. Yet, FL inevitably introduces inefficiencies compared to centralized model training, which will further increase the already high energy usage and associated carbon emissions of machine learning in the future. One idea to reduce FL's carbon footprint is to schedule training jobs based on the availability of renewable excess energy that can occur at certain times and places in the grid. However, in the presence of such volatile and unreliable resources, existing FL schedulers cannot always ensure fast, efficient, and fair training. We propose FedZero, an FL system that operates exclusively on renewable excess energy and spare capacity of compute infrastructure to effectively reduce a training's operational carbon emissions to zero. Using energy and load forecasts, FedZero leverages the spatio-temporal availability of excess resources by selecting clients for fast convergence and fair participation. Our evaluation, based on real solar and load traces, shows that FedZero converges significantly faster than existing approaches under the mentioned constraints while consuming less energy. Furthermore, it is robust to forecasting errors and scalable to tens of thousands of clients.},

However, such models face several problems during the learning process, mainly due to the redundancy of the individual neurons, which results in sub-optimal accuracy or the need for additional training steps. Here, we explore the diversity of the neurons within the hidden layer during the learning process, and analyze how the diversity of the neurons affects predictions of the model. As following, we introduce several techniques to dynamically reinforce diversity between neurons during the training. These decorrelation techniques improve learning at early stages and occasionally help to overcome local minima faster. Additionally, we describe novel weight initialization method to obtain decorrelated, yet stochastic weight initialization for a fast and efficient neural network training. Decorrelated weight initialization in our case shows about 40\% relative increase in test accuracy during the first 5 epochs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cloud datacenters capable of provisioning high performance Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) at reduced resource cost is achieved via auto-tuning: automated tensor program optimization of Deep Learning models to minimize inference latency within a hardware device. However given the extensive heterogeneity of Deep Learning models, libraries, and hardware devices, performing auto-tuning within Cloud datacenters incurs a significant time, compute resource, and energy cost of which state-of-the-art auto-tuning is not designed to mitigate. In this paper we propose Trimmer, a high performance and cost-efficient Deep Learning auto-tuning framework for Cloud datacenters. Trimmer maximizes DL model performance and tensor program cost-efficiency by preempting tensor program implementations exhibiting poor optimization improvement; and applying an ML-based filtering method to replace expensive low performing tensor programs to provide greater likelihood of selecting low latency tensor programs. Through an empirical study exploring the cost of DL model optimization techniques, our analysis indicates that 26-43\% of total energy is expended on measuring tensor program implementations that do not positively contribute towards auto-tuning. Experiment results show that Trimmer achieves high auto-tuning cost-efficiency across different DL models, and reduces auto-tuning energy use by 21.8-40.9\% for Cloud clusters whilst achieving DL model latency equivalent to state-of-the-art techniques.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The process of analysing obtained data can benefit the community financially and securely, for instance observing stock exchange trends and predicting malicious attacks whenabout. MTS forecasting models face many problems including data and model complexity, energy constraints and computational cost. These problems could affect budget allocation, latency and carbon emission. Recurrent neural networks are one of these models, which are known for their computational complexity due to slow learning process which requires more energy to train. Contributing to green AI, in this paper, we propose a competitive and energy-efficient lightweight recurrent neural network based on a hybrid neural architecture that combines Random Neural Network (RaNN) and Simple Recurrent Network (SRN), namely Random Simple Recurrent Network (RSRN). We consider RaNN for its distinctive probabilistic properties and SRN for adding lightweight recurrent ability to the RaNN to process sequential data. The paper shows how RSRN is trained using adapted and optimised versions of back propagation (BP), back propagation through time (BPTT) and truncated BPTT (TBPTT). The latter two algorithms use penalised gradient descent to prevent gradient explosion problems by employing the average of total gradient over time. Evaluated on several datasets, RSRN achieves best performance when using TBPTT. Moreover, we performed a comparative study against well-known recurrent models showing its superiority compared to the state-of-the-art models, while requiring much less computational time and training parameters. In addition, we investigated the multi-layer architecture and its properties. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a significant increase in the use of AI technologies. Many experts are researching and developing AI technologies in their respective fields, often submitting papers and patent applications as a result. In particular, owing to the characteristics of the patent system that is used to protect the exclusive rights to registered technology, patent documents contain detailed information on the developed technology. Therefore, in this study, we propose a statistical method for analyzing patent data on AI technology to improve our understanding of sustainable technology in the field of AI. We collect patent documents that are related to AI technology, and then analyze the patent data to identify sustainable AI technology. In our analysis, we develop a statistical method that combines social network analysis and Bayesian modeling. Based on the results of the proposed method, we provide a technological structure that can be applied to understand the sustainability of AI technology. To show how the proposed method can be applied to a practical problem, we apply the technological structure to a case study in order to analyze sustainable AI technology. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As research and deployment of AI grows, the computational burden to support and sustain its progress inevitably does too. To train or fine-tune state-of-the-art models in NLP, computer vision, etc., some form of AI hardware acceleration is virtually a requirement. Recent large language models require considerable resources to train and deploy, resulting in significant energy usage, potential carbon emissions, and massive demand for GPUs and other hardware accelerators. However, this surge carries large implications for energy sustainability at the HPC/datacenter level. In this paper, we study the effects of power-capping GPUs at a research supercomputing center on GPU temperature and power draw; we show significant decreases in both temperature and power draw, reducing power consumption and potentially improving hardware life-span, with minimal impact on job performance. To our knowledge, our work is the first to conduct and make available a detailed analysis of the effects of GPU power-capping at the supercomputing scale. We hope our work will inspire HPCs/datacenters to further explore, evaluate, and communicate the impact of power-capping AI hardware accelerators for more sustainable AI. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {The PICUS Lab has been conducting research activities in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with a focus on ethics. One area of research has been the modification of transformer-based models to make them more sustainable while maintaining performance. To achieve this goal, we have explored sustainable alternatives for the internal components of these models, such as retrieval-based techniques and diffusion modules for programmability. The aim is to pave the way for the development of ethical and sustainable AI systems that do not rely on massive computing and data, which can lead to high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Another area of research at PICUS Lab has been deepfake detection, a pressing concern due to the potential spread of false information and manipulation of public opinion. To address this issue, we developed FEAD-D (Face Expression Analysis for Deepfake Detection), a tool based on facial expression analysis. The system uses a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model and data from the DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) to detect fake videos in about two minutes. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	abstract = {Current deep learning architectures are growing larger in order to learn from complex datasets. These architectures require giant matrix multiplication operations to train millions of parameters. Conversely, there is another growing trend to bring deep learning to low-power, embedded devices. The matrix operations, associated with the training and testing of deep networks, are very expensive from a computational and energy standpoint. We present a novel hashing-based technique to drastically reduce the amount of computation needed to train and test neural networks. Our approach combines two recent ideas, Adaptive Dropout and Randomized Hashing for Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS), to select the nodes with the highest activations eficiently. Our new algorithm for deep learning reduces the overall computational cost of the forward and backward propagation steps by operating on significantly fewer nodes. As a consequence, our algorithm uses only 5\% of the total multiplications, while keeping within 1\% of the accuracy of the original model on average. A unique property of the proposed hashing-based back-propagation is that the updates are always sparse. Due to the sparse gradient updates, our algorithm is ideally suited for asynchronous, parallel training, leading to near-linear speedup, as the number of cores increases. We demonstrate the scalability and sustainability (energy eficiency) of our proposed algorithm via rigorous experimental evaluations on several datasets. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

However, its implementation uses large amounts of resources and releases CO2. With the requirement of green and low-carbon resource sustainability, deep learning-based SEI faces the great challenge of compressing the model while ensuring its performance. In this article, we propose a novel green and low resource specific emitter identification method using complex networks and Fisher pruning (GLR-SEI). Specifically, we divide the learning process into two stages: knowledge distillation and fisher pruning, which involves transferring knowledge from complex number networks to real number networks. The proposed approach is evaluated using aircraft Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data collected in the real world and many pruning experiments are performed. In addition, we add descriptive experiments on Raspberry Pi to provide a more effective data presentation in order to better demonstrate our research results. The experimental results show that the proposed lightweight network in this article can reduce the recognition rate by only 0.7\&\#x0025; and the inference time by 10.1\&\#x0025; compared to the complex neural network.

Lower energy consumption or compute budget is always desirable, if accuracy is not reduced below a usable level. We present an approach using the state of the art Vision Transformer and Early Exits for reducing compute budget without significantly affecting performance.

However, this exponential growth has raised pressing concerns about environmental sustainability and data privacy. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces One-shot Federated Learning (OSFL), an innovative paradigm that harmonizes sustainability and machine learning within IoT ecosystems. OSFL revolutionizes the traditional Federated Learning (FL) workflow by condensing multiple iterative communication rounds into a single operation, thus significantly reducing energy consumption, communication overhead, and latency. This breakthrough is coupled with the strategic integration of generative learning techniques, ensuring robust data privacy while promoting efficient knowledge sharing among IoT devices. By curtailing resource utilization, OSFL aligns seamlessly with the vision of green and sustainable IoT, effectively extending device lifespans and mitigating their environmental footprint. Our research underscores the transformative potential of OSFL, poised to reshape the landscape of IoT applications across domains such as energy-efficient smart cities and groundbreaking healthcare solutions.

	abstract = {The increasing usage of edge devices and stricter data privacy regulations motivate the use of federated learning (FL). At the same time, more and more stakeholders are concerned about the ecological impact of machine learning and its associate network traffic. The current research in FL does not investigate the impact of different network constraints and privacy-enhancing techniques, such as differential privacy, on the network traffic and energy consumption of the clients. Most experiments run either on virtual machines or on one machine with simulated clients. In such environments, it is challenging to measure each client's network and energy usage. Therefore, we built our "Distributed Edge Device Testbed"(DEDT) and evaluate a convolutional neural network trained on the MNIST data set under different network constraints on DEDT, with differential privacy and with an increasing amount of participating clients. For each experiment, we quantify the network traffic, energy consumption, and training time. The results show the importance of experiments on physically separated nodes and the need to improve software-based power monitoring. The estimated energy consumption deviates by up to 35 \% from the measured ones. The accuracy of the estimated network traffic depends on the monitored network interface and gives an error of 18 \% for virtual machines in combination with monitoring the Ethernet interface. The training time also increases linearly with the number of participating clients. © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Location based services, already popular with end users, are now inevitably becoming part of new wireless infrastructures and emerging business processes. The increasingly popular Deep Learning (DL) artificial intelligence methods perform very well in wireless fingerprinting localization based on extensive indoor radio measurement data. However, with the increasing complexity these methods become computationally very intensive and energy hungry, both for their training and subsequent operation. Considering only mobile users, estimated to exceed 7.4 billion by the end of 2025, and assuming that the networks serving these users will need to perform only one localization per user per hour on average, the machine learning models used for the calculation would need to perform 65×1012 predictions per year. Add to this equation tens of billions of other connected devices and applications that rely heavily on more frequent location updates, and it becomes apparent that localization will contribute significantly to carbon emissions unless more energy-efficient models are developed and used. This motivated our work on a new DL-based architecture for indoor localization that is more energy efficient compared to related state-of-the-art approaches while showing only marginal performance degradation. A detailed performance evaluation shows that the proposed model produces only 58\% of the carbon footprint while maintaining 98.7\% of the overall performance compared to state of the art model external to our group. Additionally, we elaborate on a methodology to calculate the complexity of the DL model and thus the CO2 footprint during its training and operation. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cellular traffic prediction is a crucial activity for optimizing networks in fifth-generation (5G) networks and beyond, as accurate forecasting is essential for intelligent network design, resource allocation and anomaly mitigation. Although machine learning (ML) is a promising approach to effectively predict network traffic, the centralization of massive data in a single data center raises issues regarding confidentiality, privacy and data transfer demands. To address these challenges, federated learning (FL) emerges as an appealing ML training framework which offers high accurate predictions through parallel distributed computations. However, the environmental impact of these methods is often overlooked, which calls into question their sustainability. In this paper, we address the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption in FL by proposing a novel sustainability indicator that allows assessing the feasibility of ML models. Then, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures in a federated scenario using realworld measurements from base station (BS) sites in the area of Barcelona, Spain. Our findings indicate that larger ML models achieve marginally improved performance but have a significant environmental impact in terms of carbon footprint, which make them impractical for real-world applications. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques have recently demonstrated remarkable success in numerous domains. Typically, the success of these deep learning models is measured in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy and mean average precision (mAP). Generally, a model’s high performance is highly valued, but it frequently comes at the expense of substantial energy costs and carbon footprint emissions during the model building step. Massive emission of CO2 has a deleterious impact on life on earth in general and is a serious ethical concern that is largely ignored in deep learning research. In this article, we mainly focus on environmental costs and the means of mitigating carbon footprints in deep learning models, with a particular focus on models created using knowledge distillation (KD). Deep learning models typically contain a large number of parameters, resulting in a ‘heavy’ model. A heavy model scores high on performance metrics but is incompatible with mobile and edge computing devices. Model compression techniques such as knowledge distillation enable the creation of lightweight, deployable models for these low-resource devices. KD generates lighter models and typically performs with slightly less accuracy than the heavier teacher model (model accuracy by the teacher model on CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and TinyImageNet is 95.04\%, 76.03\%, and 63.39\%; model accuracy by KD is 91.78\%, 69.7\%, and 60.49\%). Although the distillation process makes models deployable on low-resource devices, they were found to consume an exorbitant amount of energy and have a substantial carbon footprint (15.8, 17.9, and 13.5 times more carbon compared to the corresponding teacher model). The enormous environmental cost is primarily attributable to the tuning of the hyperparameter, Temperature (τ). In this article, we propose measuring the environmental costs of deep learning work (in terms of GFLOPS in millions, energy consumption in kWh, and CO2 equivalent in grams). In order to create lightweight models with low environmental costs, we propose a straightforward yet effective method for selecting a hyperparameter (τ) using a stochastic approach for each training batch fed into the models. We applied knowledge distillation (including its data-free variant) to problems involving image classification and object detection. To evaluate the robustness of our method, we ran experiments on various datasets (CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, Tiny ImageNet, and PASCAL VOC) and models (ResNet18, MobileNetV2, Wrn-40-2). Our novel approach reduces the environmental costs by a large margin by eliminating the requirement of expensive hyperparameter tuning without sacrificing performance. Empirical results on the CIFAR 10 dataset show that the stochastic technique achieves an accuracy of 91.67\%, whereas tuning achieves an accuracy of 91.78\%—however, the stochastic approach reduces the energy consumption and CO2 equivalent each by a factor of 19. Similar results have been obtained with CIFAR 100 and TinyImageNet dataset. This pattern is also observed in object detection classification on the PASCAL VOC dataset, where the tuning technique performs similarly to the stochastic technique, with a difference of 0.03\% mAP favoring the stochastic technique while reducing the energy consumptions and CO2 emission each by a factor of 18.5. © 2023 Rafat et al.

We developed MIEV, a model inference emission visualizer, that supports ML developers on TensorFlow Hub to explore the carbon intensity of image domain models during the model Inference phase. We also provide insights into designing technologies that promote collaborative work among ML developers to drive sustainable AI development processes.

To date it has reported significant accomplishments in many areas that have been deemed as challenging for machines, ranging from computer vision, natural language processing, audio analysis to smart sensing and many others. The technical trend in realizing the successes has been towards increasing complex and large size AI models so as to solve more complex problems at superior performance and robustness. This rapid progress, however, has taken place at the expense of substantial environmental costs and resources. Besides, debates on the societal impacts of AI, such as fairness, safety and privacy, have continued to grow in intensity. These issues have presented major concerns pertaining to the sustainable development of AI. In this work, we review major trends in machine learning approaches that can address the sustainability problem of AI. Specifically, we examine emerging AI methodologies and algorithms for addressing the sustainability issue of AI in two major aspects, i.e., environmental sustainability and social sustainability of AI. We will also highlight the major limitations of existing studies and propose potential research challenges and directions for the development of next generation of sustainable AI techniques. We believe that this technical review can help to promote a sustainable development of AI R\&D activities for the research community.},

The needs for high computing power brings higher carbon emission and undermines research fairness by preventing small or medium-sized research institutions and companies with limited funding in participating in research. To tackle the challenges of computing resources and environmental impact of AI, Green Computing has become a hot research topic. In this survey, we give a systematic overview of the technologies used in Green Computing. We propose the framework of Green Computing and devide it into four key components: (1) Measures of Greenness, (2) Energy-Efficient AI, (3) Energy-Efficient Computing Systems and (4) AI Use Cases for Sustainability. For each components, we discuss the research progress made and the commonly used techniques to optimize the AI efficiency. We conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address the conflicts between resource constraints and AI development.

While many approaches have been proposed to make AI more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, environmental inequity -- the fact that AI's environmental footprint can be disproportionately higher in certain regions than in others -- has emerged, raising social-ecological justice concerns. This paper takes a first step toward addressing AI's environmental inequity by balancing its regional negative environmental impact. Concretely, we focus on the carbon and water footprints of AI model inference and propose equity-aware geographical load balancing (GLB) to explicitly address AI's environmental impacts on the most disadvantaged regions. We run trace-based simulations by considering a set of 10 geographically-distributed data centers that serve inference requests for a large language AI model. The results demonstrate that existing GLB approaches may amplify environmental inequity while our proposed equity-aware GLB can significantly reduce the regional disparity in terms of carbon and water footprints.},

	abstract = {The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the sports domain, known as AI Sports, has gained considerable attention, while the increasing importance of environmental sustainability further necessitates exploring green-conscious behaviors. This study aims to investigate the impacts of technology readiness, perceived usefulness, and green consciousness on users’ willingness to adopt AI Sports. Utilizing a cross-sectional survey and structural equation modeling, data from 670 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The results revealed that technology readiness directly influences users’ perceived usefulness of AI Sports, while green awareness significantly affects perceived usefulness, highlighting the relative scarcity of research on green consciousness in this context. Moreover, perceived usefulness plays a crucial role in predicting users’ willingness to use AI Sports, contributing to its sustainable development and widespread adoption. This study fills a research gap by exploring the importance of green consciousness in the field of artificial intelligence sports, and provides important insights for the development and promotion of sustainable artificial intelligence sports. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The dreaming Hopfield model constitutes a generalization of the Hebbian paradigm for neural networks, that is able to perform on-line learning when “awake” and also to account for off-line “sleeping” mechanisms. The latter have been shown to enhance storing in such a way that, in the long sleep-time limit, this model can reach the maximal storage capacity achievable by networks equipped with symmetric pairwise interactions. In this paper, we inspect the minimal amount of information that must be supplied to such a network to guarantee a successful generalization, and we test it both on random synthetic and on standard structured datasets (i.e., MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Olivetti). By comparing these minimal thresholds of information with those required by the standard (i.e., always “awake”) Hopfield model, we prove that the present network can save up to ∼90\% of the dataset size, yet preserving the same performance of the standard counterpart. This suggests that sleep may play a pivotal role in explaining the gap between the large volumes of data required to train artificial neural networks and the relatively small volumes needed by their biological counterparts. Further, we prove that the model Cost function (typically used in statistical mechanics) admits a representation in terms of a standard Loss function (typically used in machine learning) and this allows us to analyze its emergent computational skills both theoretically and computationally: a quantitative picture of its capabilities as a function of its control parameters is achieved and consistency between the two approaches is highlighted. The resulting network is an associative memory for pattern recognition tasks that learns from examples on-line, generalizes correctly (in suitable regions of its control parameters) and optimizes its storage capacity by off-line sleeping: such a reduction of the training cost can be inspiring toward sustainable AI and in situations where data are relatively sparse. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In recent years, the increase in the use of services in cloud, fog, edge, and IoT ecosystems has been very notable. On the one hand, environmental sustainability is affected by this type of ecosystem since it can produce a large amount of energy consumption which translates into CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. On the other hand, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of these ecosystems has increased considerably. Thus, it is necessary to apply policies and techniques to maximize sustainability within these ecosystems. Some of these policies and techniques are those based on artificial intelligence. However, the current processing of these policies and techniques can also consume a lot of resources. From this perspective, this article aims to clarify whether the sustainability of cloud/fog/edge/IoT ecosystems is improved by the application of artificial intelligence. To do this, a systematic literature review is developed in this paper. In addition, a set of classifications of the analyzed works is proposed based on the different aspects related to these ecosystems, their sustainability, and the applicability of artificial intelligence to improve them. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The growing interest in AI services has led to a higher demand for computing power to train and execute complex AI models, causing a surge in power consumption in data centers. Together with rising costs for electricity, gas, petroleum, and coal, and the national target for climate neutrality of data centers by 2027, the ability to operate data centers economically is threatened in Germany. To address these issues, a pressing need to improve the sustainability of data centers and that of artificial intelligence. This paper proposes a roadmap to develop sustainable and resource-efficient data centers and AI systems. The roadmap includes four key building blocks: sustainable data centers, AI algorithms, AI sustainability framework, and economic efficiency analysis.

This article aims to provide software practitioners with a theoretically grounded and practically tested approach that enables an initial understanding of the potential multidimensional impacts. Subsequently, the results form the basis for discussions on AI software requirements. The approach is based on the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF) and Participatory Design. We conducted three workshops on different AI topics: 1. Autonomous Driving, 2. Music Composition, and 3. Memory Avatars. Based on the results of the workshops we conclude that a two-level approach should be adopted: First, a broad one that includes a diverse selection of stakeholders and overall impact analysis. Then, in a second step, specific approaches narrowing down the stakeholders and focusing on one or few impact areas. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we would like to propose an application of the concept of sustainability to technological processes and in particular to the elaboration of AI systems. To reach this goal we will first try to build an ethical framework, here called Dynamical Techno-Algor-Ethical Composition, to define the interaction between the most important ethical ingredients involving the human person in relation to technology, taking a person-centered approach. Out of this will emerge a possible structure and definition of Technological Sustainability. The second step will consist of evaluating the process for the elaboration of an AI algorithm as a concrete application of the previously analyzed framework, to set ethical contents composing what we might call a good and sustainable algorithm. © 2022 by the author.

	abstract = {Recently, we are witnessing truly groundbreaking achievements using AI models, such as the much talked about generative large language models, the broader area of foundation models, and the wide range of applications with a tremendous potential to accelerate scientific discovery, and enhance productivity. AI models and their use are growing at a super-linear pace. Inference jobs are measured by the trillions, and model parameters by the billions. This scaling up comes with a tremendous environmental cost, associated with every aspect of models’ life cycle: data preparation, pre-training, and post deployment re-training, inference, and, the embodied emission of the systems used to support the execution. There is an urgent need for the community to come together and conduct a meaningful conversation about the environmental cost of AI. To do that, we ought to develop an agreed upon set of metrics, methodology, and framework to quantify AI’s sustainability cost in a holistic and complete fashion. In this paper, we propose unified AI Sustainability metrics that can help foster a sustainability mind-set and enable analysis, and strategy setting. To do that, we build on and extend the data center sustainability metrics, defined in [19], by introducing (for the first time to our knowledge) the concept of embodied product emission (EPC) to capture the creation cost of software assets, such as software platforms, models, and data-sets. We then use this new concept to expand the job sustainability cost metrics (JCS and ASC) offered in [19] to factor in the context of the execution of jobs, such as a platform as-a-service, or a model serving inference jobs. The result is applicable to any data center job, not just for AI, and contributes towards accuracy and completeness. We then show how to apply this approach to AI, with a particular focus on the entire life cycle, including all phases of the life cycle, as well as the provenance of models, where one model is used (distilled) to create another one. We demonstrate how the metric can be used to inform a more meaningful debate about AI strategies and cost. Te novelty of the approach is that it can be used to reason about strategies and trade-offs across the life cycle and’supply-chain’ of models. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

With increasing digitization and data availability in the energy sector, data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches emerged, showing high potential. So far, research has focused on optimizing ML approaches’ prediction performance. However, this is a one-sided perspective. ML approaches require large computation times and capacities leading to high energy consumption. With the goal of sustainable energy systems, research on ML approaches should be extended to include the application’s energy consumption. ML solutions must be designed in such a way that the resulting savings in energy (and emissions) are greater than the energy consumption caused using the ML solution. To address this need, we develop the Sustainable Machine Learning Balance Sheet as a framework allowing to holistically evaluate and develop sustainable ML solutions which we validated in a case study and through expert interviews. © 2022 17th International Conference on Wirtschaftsinformatik, WI 2022.

By outlining the latest developments into a platform canvas for carbon neutrality management and services, this report identifies the potential of “AI of the environment” (i.e., the material composition and environmental impact of AI itself) and “AI for the environment” (i.e., the purposeful use of smart applications to benefit the environment). The role of AI is contextualized in the digital platform design for the provision of services on carbon emission data, which serves as the material foundation for smart services facing both the producers and the consumers of such information. Contributing to the design of business models that enable open innovations, this report discusses the emission impact reduction mechanisms that can optimize, substitute, induce, manage, and facilitate processes and services, indicating the potential of AI-enabled smart services such as forecasting, planning, and recommendation systems. Despite the limited disciplinary considerations and detailed discussions on specific AI technologies, this report provides a simple, practical, and flexible technology roadmap that can be used as a guide for researchers and practitioners to refine their operations and designs and to follow best practices. This report succinctly visualizes key elements of digital platforms of/for GHG emission reduction and their enabling mechanisms, serving as an AI technology roadmap for future research and innovation in the field.

However, the technical, ethical, and legal literature on how AI, including its design, training, implementation, and use can be sustainable, is rather limited. At the same time, consumers incrementally pay more attention to sustainability information, whereas businesses are increasingly engaging in greenwashing practices, especially in relation to digital products and services, raising concerns about the efficiency of the existing consumer protection framework in this regard. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the discussion toward sustainable AI from a legal and consumer protection standpoint while focusing on the environmental and societal pillar of sustainability. After analyzing the multidisciplinary literature available on the topic of the environmentally sustainable AI lifecycle, as well as the latest EU policies and initiatives regarding consumer protection and sustainability, we will examine whether the current consumer protection framework is sufficient to promote sharing and substantiation of sustainability information in B2C contracts involving AI products and services. Moreover, we will assess whether AI-related AI initiatives can promote a sustainable AI development. Finally, we will propose a set of recommendations capable of encouraging a sustainable and environmentally-conscious AI lifecycle while enhancing information transparency among stakeholders, aligning the various EU policies and initiatives, and ultimately empowering consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

It is now widely acknowledge that the development of these models has an environmental cost that has been analyzed in many studies. Several online and software tools have been developed to track energy consumption while training machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive introduction and comparison of these tools for AI practitioners wishing to start estimating the environmental impact of their work. We review the specific vocabulary, the technical requirements for each tool. We compare the energy consumption estimated by each tool on two deep neural networks for image processing and on different types of servers. From these experiments, we provide some advice for better choosing the right tool and infrastructure. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the past ten years, artificial intelligence has encountered such dramatic progress that it is now seen as a tool of choice to solve environmental issues and, in the first place, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). At the same time, the deep learning community began to realize that training models with more and more parameters require a lot of energy and, as a consequence, GHG emissions. To our knowledge, questioning the complete net environmental impacts of AI solutions for the environment (AI for Green) and not only GHG, has never been addressed directly. In this article, we propose to study the possible negative impacts of AI for Green. First, we review the different types of AI impacts; then, we present the different methodologies used to assess those impacts and show how to apply life cycle assessment to AI services. Finally, we discuss how to assess the environmental usefulness of a general AI service and point out the limitations of existing work in AI for Green. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {‘Sustainable AI’ sets itself apart from other AI ethics frameworks by its inherent regard for the ecological costs of AI, a concern that has so far been woefully overlooked in the policy space. Recently, two German-based research and advocacy institutions have published a joint report on Sustainability Criteria for Artificial Intelligence. This is, to our knowledge, the first AI ethics document in the policy space that puts sustainability at the center of its considerations. We take this as an opportunity to highlight the foundational problems we see in current debates about AI ethics guidelines. Although we do believe the concept of sustainability has the potential to introduce a paradigm shift, we question whether the suggestions and conceptual grounding found in this report have the strength to usher it in. We show this by presenting this new report as an example of current approaches to AI ethics and identify the problems of this approach, which we will describe as ‘checklist ethics’ and ‘ethics of carefulness’. We argue to opt for an ‘ethics of desirability’ approach. This can be completed, we suggest, by reconceptualizing sustainability as a property of complex systems. Finally, we offer a set of indications for further research. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Yet tools for calculating environmental impact of AI are more adapted for other contexts than creative practices, making them sometimes hard to comprehend for the non-expert. In this study, based on interviews with AI artists, a design artifact called The Green Notebook was developed: a physical notebook where the AI artist could discuss ideas and receive feedback of their expected environmental impact. The conversational experience between the artist and the interface was informed by online content analysis of artistic work processes. The Notebook was explored and assessed with five artists in Wizard-of-Oz and focus group studies. Generally, the participants found a co-creation process with the enhanced ability to reflect on sustainability an accessible way to engage with sustainability considerations of their AI artistic practices. We provide insights of the Notebook's perceived role and the conversational strategies used by the artists.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are becoming common in our daily lives. The AI-driven processes significantly affect us as individuals and as a society, spanning across ethical dimensions like discrimination, misinformation, and fraud. Several of these AI \& ML approaches rely on Knowledge Graph (KG) data. Due to the large volume and complexity of today's KG-driven approaches, enormous resources are spent to utilize the complex AI approaches. Efficient usage of the resources like hardware and power consumption is essential for sustainable KG-based ML technologies. This paper introduces the ethical and sustainability considerations, challenges, and optimizations in the context of KG-based ML. We have grouped the ethical and sustainability aspects according to the typical Research \& Development (R\&D) lifecycle: an initial investigation of the AI approach's responsibility dimensions; technical system setup; central KG data analytics and curating; model selection, training, and evaluation; and final technology deployment. We also describe significant trade-offs and alternative options for dedicated scenarios enriched through existing and reported ethical and sustainability issues in AIdriven approaches and research. These include, e.g., efficient hardware usage guidelines; or the trade-off between transparency and accessibility compared to the risk of manipulability and privacy-related data disclosure. In addition, we propose how biased data and barely explainable AI can result in discriminating ML predictions. This work supports researchers and developers in reflecting, evaluating, and optimizing dedicated KG-based ML approaches in the dimensions of ethics and sustainability.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning in particular have increasing computational requirements, with a corresponding increase in energy consumption. There is a tremendous opportunity to reduce the computational cost and environmental impact of deep learning by accelerating neural network architecture search and hyperparameter optimization, as well as explicitly designing neural architectures that optimize for both energy efficiency and performance. Here, we introduce a framework called training performance estimation (TPE), which builds upon existing techniques for training speed estimation in order to monitor energy consumption and rank model performance-without training models to convergence-saving up to 90\% of time and energy of the full training budget. We benchmark TPE in the computationally intensive, well-studied domain of computer vision and in the emerging field of graph neural networks for machine-learned inter-atomic potentials, an important domain for scientific discovery with heavy computational demands. We propose variants of early stopping that generalize this common regularization technique to account for energy costs and study the energy costs of deploying increasingly complex, knowledge-informed architectures for AI-accelerated molecular dynamics and image classification. Our work enables immediate, significant energy savings across the entire pipeline of model development and deployment and suggests new research directions for energy-aware, knowledge-informed model architecture development.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness on the need for a more comprehensive approach on the interdependence between artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental sustainability. It provides an overview of existing sustainable AI policy initiatives at the national and regional level. More precisely, it discusses whether existing European Union (EU) environmental policies are suitable for the AI era or whether new regulations are needed in this field. Finally, this paper assesses cross-fertilisation opportunities between the EU and non-EU countries. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a qualitative analysis of sustainable applications of AI and the sustainability of AI. Emphasis is laid on the latter, and a “sustainable by design” approach is proposed, which in essence is a prerequisite for transparent, responsible and human-centred AI systems. The analysis primarily focuses on environmental sustainability. Findings: The majority of studies focus on how to use AI to protect the environment with very little attention paid to sustainable design of AI. On the other hand, the EU’s comprehensive approach towards sustainable AI is closest to promoting “sustainable by design” AI. Several ways have been identified in which the EU’s actions can be translated beyond its borders. Research limitations/implications: One of the largest limitations of this study is its moderate scope. This paper is confined to the EU and as such provides a limited assessment of global policies and measures on the interplay between sustainability and AI. Consequently, the paper did not provide an in-depth analysis of environmental policies worldwide that could help provide a better picture of possible cooperation areas or common grounds. Another limitation of this study is that it primarily focuses on environmental aspects and as such accords little attention to the economic and social pillars of sustainability. Social implications: With less than 10 years to go before reaching the sustainable development goal deadline, this study can help stakeholders better understand what is being done worldwide in terms of sustainable AI. Moreover, given that the technology is still in its early phase, this study can inspire a “sustainable by design” approach to the development of AI technologies. Originality/value: All national AI strategies published by 1 June 2021 were analysed to identify whether and to what extent they prioritise the interplay between environment and AI. Furthermore, the authors also looked at the EU policy and how it aims to address AI from a sustainable perspective. © 2022, Natasa Perucica and Katarina Andjelkovic.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing research and development (RandD) discipline which is attracting increasing attention because it promises to bring vast benefits for consumers and businesses, with considerable benefits promised in productivity growth and innovation. To date, significant accomplishments have been reported in many areas that have been deemed challenging for machines, ranging from computer vision, natural language processing, audio analysis to smart sensing and many others. The technology trend in realizing success has developed towards increasingly complex and large-size AI models to solve more complex problems at superior performance and robustness. This rapid progress, however, has taken place at the expense of substantial environmental costs and resources. In addition, debates on the societal impacts of AI, such as fairness, safety, and privacy, have continued to grow in intensity. These issues have reflected major concerns pertaining to the sustainable development of AI. In this work, major trends in machine learning approaches that can address the sustainability problem of AI have been reviewed. Specifically, the emerging AI methodologies and algorithms are examined for addressing the sustainability issue of AI in two major aspects, i.e., environmental sustainability and social sustainability of AI. Then, the major limitations of the existing studies are highlighted, and potential research challenges and directions are proposed for the development of the next generation of sustainable AI techniques. It is believed that this technical review can help promote a sustainable development of AI RandD activities for the research community. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the ever-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems, the carbon footprint of AI is no longer negligible. AI researchers and practitioners are therefore urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models they design and use. This led in recent years to the appearance of researches tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI. Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this article, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm-agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115\%, with savings over 50\% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) will not just change our lives but bring about revolutionary transformation. AI can augment efficiencies of good and bad things and thus has been considered both an opportunity and risk for the sustainable development of humans. This study designed a survey to collect 1018 samples of educated people with access to the internet in Taiwan regarding their perceptions of AI and its connections to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The re-spondents showed high confidence in their AI knowledge. They had a very positive attitude toward AI but at the same time thought AI was risky. In general, people in Taiwan could be “rational opti-mists” regarding AI. We also examined how people think of the linkages between AI and the SDGs and found that SDG 4, SDG 9, and SDG 3 had the highest “synergy” and lowest rates of “trade-off”. Significant differences for some key questions were also identified concerning the demographic var-iables such as gender, age, education, and college major. According to the data analysis, education played as the base to construct a sustainable AI-aided town with an embedded innovative circular economy and high-quality water and energy services, making the residents live healthier lives. The findings of this study can be referred to when the perceptions of AI and sustainability issues are of interest for an emerging high-tech economy such as Taiwan and other Asian countries. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the most popular discourses in urban policy circles. Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless ei-ther struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. This is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist AI approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city trans-formation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban fu-tures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach—i.e., green AI—to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city litera-tures, practices, developments, trends and applications. The paper informs authorities and plan-ners on the importance of the adoption and deployment of AI systems that address efficiency, sustainability and equity issues in cities. © 2021 by the authors.

By automating recurring duties, AI can grow productivity and efficiency in creating. For instance, AI can research constructing designs, discover capability troubles, and generate answers, reducing the effort and time required for manual analysis. AI also can be used to optimize electricity consumption in buildings, which is a critical difficulty in the construction enterprise. Via machines gaining knowledge of algorithms to investigate electricity usage patterns, AI can discover areas wherein power may be stored and offer guidelines for enhancements. This can result in significant value financial savings and reduced carbon emissions. Moreover, AI may be used to improve the protection of creation websites. By studying statistics from sensors and cameras, AI can locate capacity dangers and alert workers to take suitable action. This could help save you from injuries and accidents on production sites, lowering the chance for workers and enhancing overall safety in the enterprise. The impact of AI on electric and electronics engineering productivity inside the creation industry is enormous. AI can transform how we layout, build, and function buildings by automating ordinary duties, optimising electricity intake, and enhancing safety. However, ensuring that AI is used ethically and responsibly and that the advantages are shared fairly throughout the enterprise is essential.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown, and technologies have intensified across all fields of life, particularly in education. AI has been applied to resources to improve skills giving teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability and drive performance. This paper, written for policymakers in the field of education, highlights the impact of AI and advancements in academic policy. These academic policymakers generate ideas and strategies for applying AI across various disciplines. There is also discussion around AI implementation in education throughout developing nations for moving towards and ensuring affordable, high-quality education for every individual. Education for sustainable development (ESD) aims to promote the development of knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions necessary to build a sustainable world, to protect and preserve the environment, and promote social equity and economic sustainability. This paper analyses how AI can be used to update learning probabilities by providing examples of how it can be integrated with existing educational systems, using data to improve educational capital and quality in developing countries. It goes on to discuss whether policymakers and institutions can reinvent and rework educational programs to polish graduates’ skills for the growing presence of AI across all disciplines. There are four main parts to this work: (1) different dimensions regarding the complexities and potential implications, (2) the pros and cons of educational sustainability policy related to AI, (3) carving out AI and its outstanding execution, and finally (4) the linkage of AI with higher education within the context of educational expansions.

	abstract = {The future of work is a major source of uncertainty, especially in sub Saharan Africa (SSA), where climate change and artificial intelligence are changing the nature of agricultural employment, and where youth population is rising steadily. At the same time, SSA has the world’s lowest rates of electricity access, presenting a barrier to economic productivity and gainful employment. According to the global tracking framework, decentralized renewable energy (DRE) technologies are fast becoming a popular vehicle for rapid delivery of electricity access, yet reports suggest the sector’s expansion is hindered by a labor and skills gap. Thus, there is an opportunity for the growth of decentralized renewables to help tackle both universal energy access (SDG 7) alongside expansion of decent work opportunities (SDG 8). However, little data exists to date to support policy interventions. Our research explores the employment potential of the DRE sector by conducting the first comprehensive DRE sector jobs survey in SSA. We collect a year’s worth of employment data from DRE companies in Kenya and Nigeria, two of the continent’s most prominent DRE markets. We find that although nascent and just beginning to scale, the sector has already grown a formal workforce comparative to traditional utility-scale power sectors and has an informal workforce that may be twice as large. This article highlights our key findings on employment footprint, workforce trends and skills gaps, providing a baseline for further data collection. Copyright © 2019 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) can transform health care by delivering medical services to underserved areas, while also filling gaps in health care provider availability. However, AI may also lead to patient harm due to fatal glitches in robotic surgery, bias in diagnosis, or dangerous recommendations. Despite concerns ethicists have identified in the use of AI in health care, the most significant consideration ought not be vulnerabilities in the software, but the environmental impact of AI. Health care emits a significant amount of carbon in many countries. As AI becomes an essential part of health care, ethical reflection must include the potential to negatively impact the environment. As such, this article will first overview the carbon emissions in health care. It will, second, offer five reasons why carbon calculations are insufficient to address sustainability in health care. Third, the article will derive normative concepts from the goals of medicine, the principles of biomedical ethics, and green bioethics—the very locus in which AI in health care sits—to propose health, justice, and resource conservation as criteria for sustainable AI in health care. In the fourth and final part of the article, examples of sustainable and unsustainable development and use of AI in health care will be evaluated through the three-fold lens of health, justice, and resource conservation. With various ethical approaches to AI in health care, the imperative for environmental sustainability must be underscored, lest carbon emissions continue to increase, harming people and planet alike. © 2022 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: The approach of this paper is argumentative, which is supported by ideas from existing literature and documents. Findings: This paper puts forward a relevant recommendation for achieving better and sustainable outcomes after the reexamination of the identified roles played by transparency within the AI technology context. The proposed recommendation is based on scientific opinion, which is justified by the roles and importance of the two approaches (compliance and integrity) in ethics management and other areas of ethical studies. Originality/value: The originality of this paper falls within the boundary of filling the gap that exists in sustainable AI technology and the roles of transparency. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Unsurprisingly, the number of meaningful studies addressing the social impacts of AI applications in several fields has been remarkable. More recently, several contributions have started exploring the ecological impacts of AI. Machine learning systems do not have a neutral environmental cost, so it is important to unravel the ecological footprint of these techno-scientific developments. In this chapter, we discuss the sustainability of AI from environmental ethics approaches. We examine the moral trade-offs that AI may cause in different moral dimensions and analyse prominent conflicts that may arise from human and more-than-human-centred concerns. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {Creating machines that can think and act just like humans has fascinated humanity for millennia. Breakthroughs of scientific and technological developments in recent decades allow us to build computers and robots that parallel or even surpass human abilities in many respects. The superhuman achievements are based on a new generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with neural networks using Deep Learning (DL). The performance of these AI systems increases exponentially, which requires exponentially increasing resources as well, including data, computational power, and energy. This development is not sustainable and there is a need for new AI approaches, which give careful consideration to limited resources. In this chapter, we discuss how new AI could benefit from lessons learnt from human brains, human intelligence, and human constraints. We describe various aspects of biological and artificial intelligence. We introduce a balanced approach based on the concepts of complementarity and multistability as manifested in human brain operation and cognitive processing. This approach provides insights into key principles of intelligence in biological brains and it helps building sustainable artificial intelligence. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, the performance of these systems may drastically deteriorate when the data are perturbed, or the environment dynamically changes, either due to natural effects or caused by manmade disturbances. The challenges are especially daunting in edge computing scenarios and on-board applications with limited resources, due to constraints on the available data, energy, computational power, while critical decisions must be made rapidly, in a robust way. A neuromorphic perspective provides crucial support under such conditions. Human brains are efficient devices using 20W power (just like a light bulb!), which is drastically less than the power consumption of today's supercomputers requiring MWs to solve specific learning tasks in an innovative way. This is not sustainable. Brains use spatio-temporal oscillations to implement pattern-based computing, going beyond the sequential symbol manipulation paradigm of traditional Turing machines. Neuromorphic spiking chips, including memristor technology, provide crucial support to the field.

	abstract = {Posthumanist literature—question mark. The question mark in the title gestures towards the conundrum that something like posthumanist literature might well be a contradiction in terms. This essay discusses the connection between posthumanism, the posthuman, and posthumanisation, on the one hand, and literature, the literary and post-literary (or the survival of literature), on the other hand. It differentiates between a literature of the posthuman and posthumanist literature. Through a close reading of some contemporary examples it shows that literature can follow a number of paths to engage with posthumanism (as a discourse) and the posthuman (as a figure) and thus respond to the ongoing (social, technological, ecological…) process of posthumanisation. Thematically, posthuman/ist literature is concerned with a variety of topics that are associated with figurations of the posthuman: climate change, artificial intelligence, androids and robots, the Anthropocene, enhancement, postanthropocentrism, the question of the animal, object ontology, cyborgisation and dis/embodiment, non/human futures, to name just the most obvious. Stylistically, however, a posthumanist literature will have to display a level of self-reflexion that problematizes the very idea of the literary as a practice and of literature as an (eminently humanist) institution. Whether examples of posthumanist literature – in this strong, ‘literal’, stylistic sense – can actually exist is explored through a reading of Don Delillo’s Point Omega and Zero K © 2020.

	abstract = {The optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a “Brussels effect” in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries. Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated directives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions between social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specifically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combining truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of defectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate- and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI systems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general. Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehensive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI). Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainability in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI). © 2023 Philipp Hacker},

However, AI solutions can be leveraged for different ends and through different means. This paper presupposes that this process is contingent upon overarching environmental security discourses. It reviews how the use of AI as presented in the literature fits into national, international, human and ecological security perspectives [1]. A national climate security discourse could emphasise military uses of AI and its role in propaganda and misinformation. The international security discourse suggests that international organisations can take advantage of AI to conduct their mission. However, transnational companies can also benefit from AI, with potential negative outcomes on consumption and resource extraction. Public–private collaboration for military AI grants transnational companies and states tools to hinder environmental movements. A human security discourse emphasises the role of AI in reaching the sustainable development goals but should consider potential power imbalances to prevent inequalities. Finally, an ecological understanding of climate security emphasises the role of algorithms in shaping our vision of the environment, and how it potentially estranges us from other cosmologies and the environmental impact of AI.

The present study aimed to estimate the water intake of urban infants receiving both breast milk and complementary feeding (CF) and to compare them with the reference AI. Methods: Sixty-four infants, 42 boys and 22 girls, aged 6-12 months on enrolment, from a low-income district of Guatemala City, were recruited to the study. Quantitative 24-h recalls and breastfeeding histories were collected in three serial interviews. The quantity of water was estimated from recipes and food composition moisture values for the CF items reported. The amount of breast milk needed to complement foods and beverages in meeting the individual energy needs was calculated, and breast milk's water contribution was derived accordingly. The total quantity of water in beverages, including human milk, liquids in recipes and moisture of foods, was tabulated as the infants' daily intake. Results: Some 56.3\% of the water needs for boys and 41.1\% for girls were satisfied by just water obtained from plain water, other complementary beverages and moisture of foods within CF, exclusive of breast milk. Adding the estimated breast milk intake, the median water intake for the infant sample was essentially equal to the 800 mL of the AI. Conclusions: The infants in this low-income community are approximating the recommended AI for daily water through the currently selected pattern of lactation and CF. © 2010 The Authors.

AI can help ensure sustainable production in agriculture by enhancing agricultural operations and decision-making. Recommendations about soil condition and pesticides or automatic devices for milking and apple picking are examples of AI applications in digital agriculture. Although AI offers many benefits in farming, AI systems may raise ethical issues and risks that should be assessed and proactively managed. Poor design and configuration of intelligent systems may impose harm and unintended consequences on digital agriculture. Invasion of farmers' privacy, damaging animal welfare due to robotic technologies, and lack of accountability for issues resulting from the use of AI tools are only some examples of ethical challenges in digital agriculture. This paper examines the ethical challenges of the use of AI in agriculture in six categories including fairness, transparency, accountability, sustainability, privacy, and robustness. This study further provides recommendations for agriculture technology providers (ATPs) and policymakers on how to proactively mitigate ethical issues that may arise from the use of AI in farming. These recommendations cover a wide range of ethical considerations, such as addressing farmers' privacy concerns, ensuring reliable AI performance, enhancing sustainability in AI systems, and reducing AI bias.

And does that mean we will have to give up our political freedom? Stretching the meaning of freedom but steering away from authoritarian options, this book proposes that, next to using other principles such as justice and equality and taking collective action and cooperating at a global level, we adopt a positive and relational conception of freedom that creates better conditions for human and non-human flourishing. In contrast to easy libertarianism and arrogant techno-solutionism, this offers a less symptomatic treatment of the global crises we face and gives technologies such as AI a role in the gathering of a new, more inclusive political collective and the ongoing participative making of new common worlds. Written in a clear and accessible style, Green Leviathan or the Poetics of Political Liberty will appeal to researchers and students working in political philosophy, environmental philosophy, and the philosophy of technology. © 2021 Mark Coeckelbergh.

Machine-learning models are known to describe many nonlinear hydrological phenomena, but up to now, they have mainly provided a single future value with a fixed information structure. This study trains and tests multi-step deep neural networks with different inputs to forecast the water stage of two sub-alpine urbanized catchments. They prove effective for one hour ahead flood stage values and occurrences. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform better when only past information on the water stage is used. Long short-term memory nets (LSTMs) are more suited to exploit the data coming from the rain gauges. Predicting a set of water stages over the following hour rather than just a single future value may help concerned agencies take the most urgent actions. The paper also shows that the architecture developed for one catchment can be adapted to similar ones maintaining high accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) land rights, sovereignty conflicts, and health outcomes have been significantly influenced by settler colonialism. This principle has driven the numerous relocations and forced assimilation of AI/AN children as well as the claiming of AI/AN lands across the United States. As tribes across the country begin to reclaim these lands and others continue to struggle for sovereignty, it is imperative to recognize that land rights are a determinant of health in AI/AN children. Aside from the demonstrated biological risks of environmental health injustices including exposure to air pollution, heavy metals, and lack of running water, AI/AN children must also face the challenges of historical trauma, the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples crisis, and health care inequity based on land allocation. Although there is an undeniable relationship between land rights and the health of AI/ AN children, there is a need for extensive research into the impacts of land rights and recognition of sovereignty on the health of AI/AN children. In this article we aim to summarize existing evidence describing the impact of these factors on the health of AI/AN children and provide strateg ies that can help pediatricians care and advocate for this population.

Green AI technologies are used to create sustainable solutions and reduce the environmental impact of AI. This paper focuses on describing the services of Green AI and the challenges associated with it at the community level. This article also highlights the accuracy levels of machine learning algorithms for various time periods. The process of choosing the appropriate input parameters for weather, locations, and complexity is outlined in this paper to examine the ML algorithms. For correcting the algorithm performance parameters, metrics like RMSE (root mean square error), MSE (mean square error), MAE (mean absolute error), and MPE (mean percentage error) are considered. Considering the performance and results of this review, the LSTM (long short-term memory) performed well in most cases. This paper concludes that highly advanced techniques have dramatically improved forecasting accuracy. Finally, some guidelines are added for further studies, needs, and challenges. However, there is still a need for more solutions to the challenges, mainly in the area of electricity storage. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {AI is transforming the existing technology landscape at a rapid phase enabling data-informed decision making and autonomous decision making. Unlike any other technology, because of the decision-making ability of AI, ethics and governance became a key concern. There are many emerging AI risks for humanity, such as autonomous weapons, automation-spurred job loss, socio-economic inequality, bias caused by data and algorithms, privacy violations and deepfakes. Social diversity, equity and inclusion are considered key success factors of AI to mitigate risks, create values and drive social justice. Sustainability became a broad and complex topic entangled with AI. Many organizations (government, corporate, not-for-proﬁts, charities and NGOs) have diversiﬁed strategies driving AI for business optimization and social-and-environmental justice. Partnerships and collaborations become important more than ever for equity and inclusion of diversiﬁed and distributed people, data and capabilities. Therefore, in our journey towards an AI-enabled sustainable future, we need to address AI ethics and governance as a priority. These AI ethics and governance should be underpinned by human ethics.},

However, as users are increasingly executing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in cloud-edge systems, existing EDR management has not been designed for AI workloads and thus faces the critical challenges of the complex trade-offs between energy consumption and AI model accuracy, the degradation of model accuracy due to AI model quantization, the restriction of AI training deadlines, and the uncertainty of AI task arrivals. In this paper, targeting Federated Learning (FL), we design an auction-based approach to overcome all these challenges. We firstly formulate a nonlinear mixed-integer program for the long-term social welfare optimization. We then propose a novel algorithmic approach that generates candidate training schedules, reformulates the original problem into a new schedule selection problem, and solves this new problem using an online primal-dual-based algorithm, with a carefully embedded payment design. We further rigorously prove that our approach achieves truthfulness and individual rationality, and leads to a constant competitive ratio for the long-term social welfare. Via extensive evaluations with real-world data and settings, we have validated the superior practical performance of our approach over multiple alternative methods. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart agriculture researchers bring numerous tools and prospects to the farm ecosystem to improve its productivity and, mainly, its sustainability. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in precision agriculture as Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have brought a huge volume of data to exploit to provide useful insights for farmers such as weather prediction, pest development detection, or harvest time estimation. AI algorithms are mostly executed in the cloud due to their inherent computing constraints, thus requiring the different sensors to offload their data to the appropriate server. Depending on the amount and volume of data exchanged, the need for computer offloading may induce privacy, security, and latency issues in addition to weighting on the sensor's battery consumption as wireless transmission methods have a high-energy demand. To overcome this difficulty, recent research has tried to bring AI computation closer to the end device with edge or fog computing and more recently with the Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) paradigm that aims to embed the AI algorithm directly into the sensor's microcontroller. In that context, this paper proposes a prototype of smart sensor capable of detecting fruits presence with TinyML. We then study the energy consumption of our system in different IoT scenarios.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world—where, in simple terms, AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Sustainable building systems can effectively reduce environmental pressures and mitigate the deterioration of the global climate. The sustainability of complex building systems is influenced by various factors. This article quantitatively analyzes building systems from an ecological emergy and carbon emissions perspective, and considers typical feedback structures’ impact. A neural network algorithm is employed for sustainability prediction analysis. The results demonstrate that both from an emergy and carbon emissions perspective, the operational phase of the building and the production phase of building materials are the main contributors (accounting for over 90\%). Among the three types of feedback subsystems, the cross-feedback structure has a more significant impact and yields the best corrective effect. For example, the correction proportion of the building’s emergy sustainability parameter reaches 11.3\%, while it is 15.8\% for carbon emissions. The neural network model predicts a decreasing trend in the energy sustainability of buildings and increasing carbon emissions over time. To improve the sustainability of building systems, measures such as ecological landscape design and carbon sequestration in building materials are considered, which can enhance the sustainability of buildings to a certain extent. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Future predictions of the world population and the demand for agricultural products per capita suggest that we have to increase food production at least two-fold by 2050 despite negative forces such as climate change with more frequent extreme weather conditions, degradation of land, increasing land scarcity, shortness of water, desertification, flooding and the loss of biodiversity for ecosystem services. One pathway how to achieve this challenge is sustainable intensification, which formulates a coarse goal rather than a detailed guideline. A heterogeneous compound of strategies is necessary and a central aspect involves examining the potential of AI technology to boost production efficiency while mitigating negative environmental consequences. Methodology: To comprehensively examine this topic, two systematic literature searches were conducted. The first aimed to gather information on sustainable agriculture and the environmental costs of conventional practices. The second focused on identifying explicit AI applications and their impact. Results: Numerous examples demonstrated how sustainable AI development drives agriculture towards a more sustainable future. The main contribution of this study is the Data-Model-Purpose matrix (DMP matrix) and the derived Bayesian matrix for a comprehensive analysis of several AI applications in agriculture and their relations to data sources and algorithms. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {High impedance faults (HIFs) on overhead power lines are known to cause fires. They are difficult to detect using conventional protection relays because the fault current is insufficient to cause tripping. The delay in detecting HIFs can result in severe bushfires and energy losses; hence a high throughput, low latency detection scheme needs to be developed for HIF detection. Moreover, the complexities associated with HIF detection demands signal processing techniques combined with artificial intelligence to achieve higher detection accuracy. This paper proposes a sustainable deep learning-based approach in an edge device, that can be mounted on top of a power pole to detect HIFs in real-time. Data acquisition, feature extraction, and deep learning based fault identification are performed in an embedded edge node to achieve higher throughput, reduced latency as well as offload the network traffic. Furthermore, optimization techniques such as hardware parallelism and pipelining are adapted to achieve real-time fault identification on edge devices while ensuring the efficient usage of its limited resources. Real-time implementation of the proposed system is validated through laboratory experiments and the results demonstrate the suitability of edge computing to detect HIFs in terms of reduced detection latency (115.2 ms) and higher detection accuracy (98.67 percent).  © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Edge computing is a popular paradigm for accelerating light- to medium-weight machine learning algorithms initiated from mobile devices without requiring the long communication latencies to send them to remote datacenters in the cloud. Edge servers primarily consider traditional concerns, such as size, weight, and power constraints for their installations. However, such metrics are not entirely sufficient to consider environmental impacts from computing given the significant contributions from embodied energy and carbon. In this article we explore the tradeoffs of hardware strategies for convolutional neural network acceleration engines considering inference and online training. In particular, we explore the use of mobile graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerators, recently released edge-class field-programmable gate arrays, and novel processing in memory (PIM) using dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and emerging Racetrack memory. Given edge servers already employ DRAM and sometimes GPU accelerators, we consider the sustainability implications using breakeven analysis of replacing or augmenting DDR3 with Racetrack memory. We also consider the implications for provisioning edge servers with different accelerators using indifference analysis. While mobile GPUs are typically much more energy efficient, their significant embodied energy can make them less sustainable than PIM solutions in certain scenarios that consider activity time and compute effort. © 1981-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Location-based services, already popular with end users, are now inevitably becoming part of new wireless infrastructures and emerging business processes. The increasingly popular deep learning (DL) artificial intelligence methods perform very well in wireless fingerprinting localization based on extensive indoor radio measurement data. However, with the increasing complexity, these methods become computationally very intensive and energy hungry, both for their training and subsequent operation. Considering only mobile users, estimated to exceed 7.4 billion by the end of 2025, and assuming that the networks serving these users will need to perform only one localization per user per hour on average, the machine learning models used for the calculation would need to perform 65â€‰×â€‰1012 predictions per year. Add to this equation tens of billions of other connected devices and applications that rely heavily on more frequent location updates, and it becomes apparent that localization will contribute significantly to carbon emissions unless more energy-efficient models are developed and used. In this chapter, we discuss the latest results and trends in wireless localization and look at paths toward achieving more sustainable AI. We then elaborate on a methodology for computing DL model complexity, energy consumption, and carbon footprint and show on a concrete example how to develop a more resource-aware model for fingerprinting. We finally compare relevant works in terms of complexity and training CO2 footprint. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {Sustainable computing is essential to our modern digital society. It deals with how computing resources and devices can be developed and used to perform operations as efficiently and eco-friendly as possible. With the explosive use of Deep Learning (DL) application systems whose development is known to be computationally intensive, this paper investigates sustainable development of DL applications to exemplify other software development. While much research on sustainable hardware development has made good progresses to reduce electronic waste and power consumption, sustainable software development is relatively behind. Most aim to find energy-efficient solutions as a result from improving computational efficiency (e.g., via optimization). This is useful but not direct. Before one can develop sustainable software, it is necessary to be able to assess and measure energy usage of the software computation. This paper presents an analytical modeling approach to quantifying energy consumption and illustrates how it can help achieve sustainable software development. In particular, we develop an energy model, for DL application systems, that has been evaluated theoretically and empirically on real systems. Unlike most existing work, our approach provides the ability to pre-determine the required energy consumption of DL applications prior to system implementation. The paper illustrates how the approach can help sustainable development of DL application system for monitoring crop health in smart agriculture in two scenarios: 1) when scaling the DL applications based on energy consumed by various design choices, and 2) when deciding whether to use sensors or drones to expand monitoring coverage. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {What do we need for sustainable artificial intelligence that is not harmful but beneficial human life? This paper builds up the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning from the human's cognitive learning process and firms' open innovation process. It conceptually establishes a direct and autonomous learning interaction model. The key factor of this model is that the process to respond to entries from external environments through interactions between autonomous learning and direct learning as well as to rearrange internal knowledge is incessant. When autonomous learning happens, the units of knowledge determinations that arise from indirect learning are separated. They induce not only broad autonomous learning made through the horizontal combinations that surpass the combinations that occurred in direct learning but also in-depth autonomous learning made through vertical combinations that appear so that new knowledge is added. The core of the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning is the variability of the boundary between proven knowledge and hypothetical knowledge, limitations in knowledge accumulation, as well as complementarity and conflict between direct and autonomous learning. Therefore, these should be considered when introducing the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning into navigations, cleaning robots, search engines, etc. In addition, we should consider the relationship between direct learning and autonomous learning when building up open innovation strategies and policies. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this work, we summarize the different ways in which protein science can negatively impact the environment and we present the carbon footprint of some popular protein algorithms: molecular simulations, inference of protein–protein interactions, and protein structure prediction. We show that large deep learning models such as AlphaFold and ESMFold can have carbon footprints reaching over 100 tonnes of CO2e in some cases. The magnitude of these impacts highlights the importance of monitoring and mitigating them, and we list actions scientists can take to achieve more sustainable protein computational science. © 2023 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved;.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a trend of shifting the execution of deep learning inference tasks toward the edge of the network, closer to the user, to reduce latency and preserve data privacy. At the same time, growing interest is being devoted to the energetic sustainability of machine learning. At the intersection of these trends, in this paper we focus on the energetic characterization of machine learning at the edge, which is attracting increasing attention. Unfortunately, calculating the energy consumption of a given neural network during inference is complicated by the heterogeneity of the possible underlying hardware implementation. In this work, we aim at profiling the energetic consumption of inference tasks for some modern edge nodes by deriving simple but accurate models. To this end, we performed a large number of experiments to collect the energy consumption of fully connected and convolutional layers on two well-known edge boards by NVIDIA, namely, Jetson TX2 and Xavier. From these experimental measurements, we have then distilled a simple and practical model that can provide an estimate of the energy consumption of a certain inference task on these edge computers. We believe that this model can prove useful in many contexts as, for instance, to guide the search for efficient neural network architectures, as a heuristic in neural network pruning, to find energy-efficient offloading strategies in a split computing context, or to evaluate and compare the energy performance of deep neural network architectures.  © 2022 IFIP.},

Two central concerns that have emerged in this respect are that the optimized goals behind the data processing of AI applications usually remain opaque and the energy footprint of their data processing is growing quickly. This study thus explores how much people value the transparency and environmental sustainability of AI using the example of personal AI assistants. The results from a choice-based conjoint analysis with a sample of more than 1.000 respondents from Germany indicate that people hardly care about the energy efficiency of AI; and while they do value transparency through explainable AI, this added value of an application is offset by minor costs. The findings shed light on what kinds of AI people are likely to demand and have important implications for policy and regulation. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Carbon neutralization, as a key approach to reverse climate change, has triggered the development of new regulations to enforce the economic activities toward low carbon solutions. Computing networks that enable users to process computation-intensive tasks contribute huge amount of carbon emissions due to rising energy consumption. To analyze the achievable reduction of carbon emissions by a scheduling policy, we first propose a novel virtual queueing network model that captures communication and computing procedures in networks. To adapt to highly variable and unpredictable nature of renewable energy utilized by computing networks (i.e., carbon intensity of grid varies by time and location), we propose a novel carbon-intensity based scheduling policy that dynamically schedules computation tasks over clouds via the drift-plus-penalty methodology in Lyapunov optimization. Our numerical analysis using real-world data shows that the proposed policy achieves 54\% reduction on the cumulative carbon emissions for AI model training tasks compared to the queue-length based policy. © 2022 IEEE.},

The paper traces the complex trajectory of AI's evolution, highlighting its operation based on statistical pattern recognition, devoid of self-consciousness or innate comprehension. As AI permeates multiple spheres of human life, it raises substantial ethical, legal, and societal concerns that demand immediate attention and deliberation. The metaphorical illustration of humans as “shepherds” of AI, coupled with a thought-provoking examination of “agency without intelligence,” engenders deep reflections on the future of human-AI interplay and the associated philosophical, ethical, and practical ramifications. The paper further elucidates critical challenges associated with AI, such as ethical dilemmas, “agency without intelligence,” the role of human oversight, and the environmental impact of AI technologies. In the pursuit of solutions, the paper maps prospective directions, emphasizing the need for robust AI policies, improved AI literacy, sustainable AI practices, and a continued dialogue on the multifaceted issues surrounding AI.

Intelligent machine-learning systems are typically performance driven. For instance, most non-parametric model-free approaches are often known to require high computational cost in order to find the global optima. Designing more accurate machine-learning systems to satisfy the market needs will hence lead to a higher likelihood of energy waste due to the increased computational cost. This paper thus introduces an energy-efficient framework for large-scale data modeling and classification. It can achieve a test error comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art machine-learning models, while at the same time, maintaining a low computational cost when dealing with large-scale data.

	abstract = {The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the environment is the subject of discourse, with arguments for both positive and negative effects. There is a fine line between AI for good and AI for environmental degradation. Today, companies want to seize the benefits of AI, which distinctively involves reducing the company's carbon footprint. However, AI's carbon emissions differ as per the techniques involved in training it. As the saying goes, a coin always has two sides. Therefore, it cannot be denied that AI can be an effective tool for combating climate change, but its role in contributing to carbon emissions cannot be ignored. Multiple studies indicate that AI could be the game-changer in staving off anthropogenic climatic changes due to the deterioration of the environment and global warming. This double-edged relationship and interdependency of AI and carbon emissions are represented through a system of systems (SoS) approach. SoS states that a plan is created through multiple smaller systems, creating complexity in the design and vice versa. A complex system can be assumed as the world in general, where two individual independent systems AI and carbon emissions, when in interaction, create a complex complementary and contradictory relation, adding to the convolution of the system. This connection is demonstrated by conducting a network analysis and calculating the carbon emissions of six machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning (DL) models with different datasets but the same hyperparameters on a carbon emission calculator created through AI algorithms. The primary idea of this study is to encourage the AI society to create efficient AI models that may be used without compromising environmental issues. The focus should be on practicing sustainable AI, that is, sustainability from data collection to model deployment, throughout the lifecycle of AI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to pinpoint and analyse ethical issues raised by the dual role of artificial intelligence (AI) in relation to climate change, that is, AI as a contributor to climate change and AI as a contributor to fighting climate change. Design/methodology/approach: This paper consists of three main parts. The first part provides a short background on AI and climate change respectively, followed by a presentation of empirical findings on the contribution of AI to climate change. The second part presents proposals by various AI researchers and commentators on how AI companies may contribute to fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from training and use of AI and by providing AI assistance to various mitigation and adaptation measures. The final part investigates ethical issues raised by some of the options presented in the second part. Findings: AI applications may lead to substantial emissions but may also play an important role in mitigation and adaptation. Given this dual role of AI, ethical considerations by AI companies and governments are of vital importance. Practical implications: This paper pinpoints practical ethical issues that AI companies and governments should take into account. Social implications: Given the potential impact of AI on society, it is vital that AI companies and governments take seriously the ethical issues raised by the dual role of AI in relation to climate change. Originality/value: AI has been the subject of substantial ethical investigation, and even more so has climate change. However, the relationship between AI and climate change has received only limited attention from an ethical perspective. This paper provides such considerations. © 2022, Anders Nordgren.},

	abstract = {As research and practice in artificial intelligence (A.I.) grow in leaps and bounds, the resources necessary to sustain and support their operations also grow at an increasing pace. While innovations and applications from A.I. have brought significant advances, from applications to vision and natural language to improvements to fields like medical imaging and materials engineering, their costs should not be neglected. As we embrace a world with ever-increasing amounts of data as well as research \& development of A.I. applications, we are sure to face an ever-mounting energy footprint to sustain these computational budgets, data storage needs, and more. But, is this sustainable and, more importantly, what kind of setting is best positioned to nurture such sustainable A.I. in both research and practice? In this paper, we outline our outlook for Green A.I. - a more sustainable, energy-efficient and energy-aware ecosystem for developing A.I. across the research, computing, and practitioner communities alike - and the steps required to arrive there. We present a bird's eye view of various areas for potential changes and improvements from the ground floor of AI's operational and hardware optimizations for datacenter/HPCs to the current incentive structures in the world of A.I. research and practice, and more. We hope these points will spur further discussion, and action, on some of these issues and their potential solutions.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Federated learning is a recent framework for communication-efficient training of machine learning models over the data collected, stored, and processed by millions of wireless devices. In this paper, we introduce a sustainable machine learning framework for federated learning, using rechargeable devices that can collect energy from the ambient environment. In particular, we propose a practical federated learning framework that utilizes intermittent energy arrivals for training, with provable convergence guarantees. Our framework can be applied to both cross-device and cross-silo federated learning settings, including federated learning in wireless edge networks and the Internet-of-Things. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can provide significant performance improvement over the benchmark energy-agnostic federated learning settings.  © 2021 IFIP.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of Deep Learning (DL) in recent years has had a large environmental impact. Training models require a lot of processing and computation and therefore require a lot of energy. The size of these models and the amount of data required for training them have grown exponentially, not comparable to the performance improvements. Recently, some model-centric approaches have been proposed to limit the environmental impact of AI. This paper complements them by proposing a data-centric “Green AI” approach, focusing on the data preparation phase of the DL pipeline. A general methodology, valid for any DL task, is proposed. This methodology is based on analyzing data characteristics, mainly the data quality and volume dimensions, and observing how these affect carbon emissions and performance on different models. With this information, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach is provided to support researchers in obtaining a modified and reduced version of a dataset that can decrease the environmental impact of training while achieving a specified performance goal. To demonstrate its validity, the proposed methodology is applied to the time series classification task and a prototype has been developed which demonstrates the possibility of reducing the carbon emissions of DL training by up to 50\%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Machine learning currently exerts an outsized influence on the world, increasingly affecting institutional practices and impacted communities. It is therefore critical that we question vague conceptions of the field as value-neutral or universally beneficial, and investigate what specific values the field is advancing. In this paper, we first introduce a method and annotation scheme for studying the values encoded in documents such as research papers. Applying the scheme, we analyze 100 highly cited machine learning papers published at premier machine learning conferences, ICML and NeurIPS. We annotate key features of papers which reveal their values: their justification for their choice of project, which attributes of their project they uplift, their consideration of potential negative consequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources. We find that few of the papers justify how their project connects to a societal need (15\%) and far fewer discuss negative potential (1\%). Through line-by-line content analysis, we identify 59 values that are uplifted in ML research, and, of these, we find that the papers most frequently justify and assess themselves based on Performance, Generalization, Quantitative evidence, Efficiency, Building on past work, and Novelty. We present extensive textual evidence and identify key themes in the definitions and operationalization of these values. Notably, we find systematic textual evidence that these top values are being defined and applied with assumptions and implications generally supporting the centralization of power. Finally, we find increasingly close ties between these highly cited papers and tech companies and elite universities.},

This paper wants to start a movement/rebellion against the ubiquitous equation of P(problem) + S(software) = S(solution) as a rational approach to the ailments of this world. We question the technological effort to “playfully” afford order and control to humans through the provision of computational rules. Instead, we propose an alternative approach: designing ‘pataphysical software to address familiar but ultimately imaginary problems. Defined by poet Alfred Jarry, ‘pataphysics is the science of imaginary problems. Adopting the methods of ‘pataphysics, we have developed mobile applications that explore invented problems and provide no solutions for them. We demonstrate how such an approach allows us to ask design questions through an aesthetic ‘pataphysical practice of software development.},

	abstract = {The growing carbon footprint of artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large ones such as GPT-3, has been undergoing public scrutiny. Unfortunately, however, the equally important and enormous water (withdrawal and consumption) footprint of AI models has remained under the radar. For example, training GPT-3 in Microsoft’s state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, but such information has been kept a secret. More critically, the global AI demand may be accountable for 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4 – 6 Denmark or half of the United Kingdom. This is very concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges shared by all of us in the wake of the rapidly growing population, depleting water resources, and aging water infrastructures. To respond to the global water challenges, AI models can, and also must, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing their own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate the water footprint of AI models, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of AI models’ runtime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable AI.},

In spite of its fundamental nature however, data collection remains an overlooked part of the machine learning (ML) pipeline. In this paper, we argue that a new specialization should be formed within ML that is focused on methodologies for data collection and annotation: efforts that require institutional frameworks and procedures. Specifically for sociocultural data, parallels can be drawn from archives and libraries. Archives are the longest standing communal effort to gather human information and archive scholars have already developed the language and procedures to address and discuss many challenges pertaining to data collection such as consent, power, inclusivity, transparency, and ethics \& privacy. We discuss these five key approaches in document collection practices in archives that can inform data collection in sociocultural ML. By showing data collection practices from another field, we encourage ML research to be more cognizant and systematic in data collection and draw from interdisciplinary expertise.},

A previous keyword analysis showed that ChatGPT use is detectable in texts of students and academics. This essay describes the impact of ChatGPT on the psychology of work from an introspective and phenomenological perspective, from the perspective of the educator. We describe six phenomena: (1) the cognitive workload associated with conducting a metaphorical Turing test to determine if ChatGPT has been used; (2) an ethical void and alienation resulting from secretive ChatGPT use; (3) insights into the motives of the sender, when the sender does not disclose having used ChatGPT, and the recipient does not reveal their awareness of the sender’s use of ChatGPT; (4) a sense of meaninglessness as texts and statements lose their fixed meanings, and no longer reveal the sender’s struggles and understanding; (5) a redefinition of utility, where certain texts may show redundancy with patterns already enclosed in the base model, while physical measurements and personal observations are seen as more unique and novel; (6) a power dynamic between sender and recipient, inadvertently leaving non-users as the disadvantaged third party. The essay makes clear that the introduction of AI tools into society has far-reaching effects, initially visible in text-related fields, such as academia, with potential to spread more broadly.},
